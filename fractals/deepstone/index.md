## Always start Left path with the Deepstone Sentinel (Air Elemental)

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">

Before the _Deepstone Sentinel_, there is a Tetris-like obstacle you have to pass. You have to avoid the green tiles because it damages you. You can dodge and block the green tiles between the safe non glowing tiles, proceed to the end. **This can be skipped by <Specialization name="Berserker"/>, <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>, like in the video down below.**

After two players passed, they stand on the cyan glowing runes to stop the Tetris trap so others can pass. <Specialization name="Elementalist"/> can use <Skill name="Lightning flash"/> to activate both button.

<GridItem sm="7">
After prestacking <Boon name="Might"/> at the Mistlock Singularity move in and the _Deepstone Sentinel_ spawns. The only dangerous attack it has is an AoE tornado (called Wind Sprites) that you have to dodge at every 20%. It is a well telegraphed attack so you only have to make sure you are not standing in it 1 second later. If it manages to catch you, others have to use CC to break you out of it before it floats you to the depths and kill you. There is a possibility you get caught even if you are not standing in it, use Skill 1 to break out of it (If you get caught in it and you stood in the AoE Skill 1 does nothing else than pinging on minimap, so keep that in mind).

The other three attacks are a mini tornado that applies <Condition name="Chilled"/> and the AoEs that <Control name="Daze"/>, the third attack is a projectile it shoots in-between which can be reflected / absorbed. After killing the _Deepstone Sentinel_ the crystal energy orb spawns, take it and interact with the Vibrant Crystal in the middle.

## The Brood Queen (Spider)

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
On your way to the _Brood Queen_ you will see spider nests, destroy them. On the bridge there are telegraphed wind currents that are unblockable. If you happen to get hit by one it puts you back at the start of the bridge with a huge penalty on time. Do not try to skip multiple wind currents at once to avoid getting reset to the start. To deactivate the puzzle and unblock the path to the _Brood Queen_ you have to stand on two cyan glowing runes towards the end of the bridge.

Sometimes the npc is lagging behind a bit causing the cyan buttons to not work. If that is the case backtrack to the _Mistlock Singularity_ which should start a dialog of the npc.

<GridItem sm="6">
Kill the two elite _Broodmother Spider_ to spawn the _Brood Queen_. This boss does not hit hard and most attack are telegraphed. After killing her the crystal energy ball comes down. Take it and you get spawned back in the middle. Take the ball to the Vibrant crystal in the end of the hall.

Use <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> to remove <Boon name="Protection"/> with <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> from the boss. If you have a <Item id="72872"/> on your set of swords or on your staff, you can use <Skill id="41220"/> to remove the <Boon name="Protection"/>.

## On the way to The Voices

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">

### Shadow Minotaur, Middle Room

After merging the second orb with the Vibrant Crystal, you get a Special Action Key skill called <SpecialActionKey name="lightofdeldrimor"/>. This skill is used to reveal hidden chest in the dungeon as well as making the mobs 10% more vulnerable and it also serves as revealing the Shadow Minotaur in the central chamber. After killing the Shadow Minotaur and the Imps the door in the middle chamber opens. Go in and move on to the next obstacle, the Maze.

Make sure to bring <Boon name="Stability"/> to negate the _Shadow Minotaurs_ frequent <Control name="Knockback"/>s.

<Tabs>
<Tab specialization="Renegade">
**<Specialization name="Renegade"/> can give <Boon name="Alacrity"/> to reduce the cooldown of <SpecialActionKey name="lightofdeldrimor"/>.** Especially helpful at the Maze part.

Use <Skill name="Lightning Flash"/>, <Skill name="Ride the Lightning"/> or <Skill id="5516"/> to move faster to to the maze and thus activate it faster.

### The Maze

Here you have to use the <SpecialActionKey name="lightofdeldrimor"/> to reveal the hidden tiles of the maze. Move to the right and the first orb of light is revealed for you. From there you proceed on to the next orb of light to your left or the bottom left on the minimap. After revealing all four orbs the maze's tiles reveal themselves and you can move on to the "elevator".

</GridItem>
</Grid>

### Elevator (Sinking platform)

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="7">
After standing on the rune in the middle of the platform it proceeds to go downward. If you didn't step in in time, no worries, there is a cyan glowing rune that teleports you down. As the platform goes down, it stops in the middle and mobs spawn. It's two waves of mobs with first being Veteran Imps only, then an Elite Minotaur and Veteran Imps. **Use the <SpecialActionKey name="lightofdeldrimor"/> to make them vulnerable** and after killing them the platform moves again. You can jump down but it can happen that you die if you jump from too high. It is more safe to wait until it is fully down.

<Tab specialization="Guardian">
Use <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> (Greatsword 5) to group the mobs.

## The Voice

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">

Before fight <Label>Pre-stack</Label>

Prestack <Boon name="Might"/> and proceed to the boss. The boss has several mechanics. The most annoying one is that he is teleporting to a random location of the arena every 10%. _The Voice_ has a couple of well telegraphed attacks, that can be easily sidestepped. In addition to that he also targets random players and throws a big ball (big AoE attack) at them, which bounces back and force. This can be negated with <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

The tiles of the arena can be revealed with the <SpecialActionKey name="lightofdeldrimor"/> skill. Spam this skill all the time and you won't have a problem with disappearing tiles.

Teleporting <Label>Breakbar</Label>

At 80% and then 40% _The Voice_ teleports away and gains a breakbar while casting beam on you that makes the tiles disappear under you. If you do not manage to break the breakbar fast enough he gains a barrier you have to remove.

Invulnerable <Label>Phases</Label>

At 60% and 20% _The Voice_ teleports to the middle, becoming invulnerable and you have to keep away _Spectral Flames_ from him. _Spectral Flames_ make the tiles disappear under them. Use <SpecialActionKey name="lightofdeldrimor"/> skill to make them invulnerable to _Spectral Flames_. If a _Spectral Flame_ manages to reach _The Voice_, he casts a huge AoE that damages you. During this phase the group should focus on killing _Shades_ as they can easily cause a wipe.

Ending <Label>20%</Label>

After the 20% invulnerability he doesn't teleport away and you can nuke him. After defeating _The Voice_ the fractal is finished.
</GridItem>

![The Voice](images/the_voice.jpg)
<Tabs>
<Tab specialization="Renegade">
Use <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> to keep the shades from CCing your party with <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/>. Alternatively you can use <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> to pull the shades together with <Skill name="Call to Anguish"/>, but this is hardly relevant with the abundance of either cleave or pulls groups have today.

## Ice Wall <Item id="8883" text="false"/><Item id="24667" text="false"/>

<Grid>
<Column>
Light up the *Bonfire* with your special action key skill. Kill the spawning *Icebrood Elementals* or use control effects like <Control name="pull"/> to prevent them from extinguishing it and throw *Firewood* into the fire to keep it burning. The stronger the bonfire, the faster the ice wall will melt - usually after around 75 seconds.

If you gain too many stacks of *Hypothermia* (one every 5 seconds), reset them at the bonfire.

When there are only a few percent remaining, go near the fire to leave combat and pre-equip <Item id="49940"/> to be faster on the bridge.

## <Boss/> Elemental Source <Item id="8885" text="false"/><Item id="24661" text="false"/>

<Grid>
<Column>
At the start of the fight, light up the five bonfires to remove the 10 stacks of *Rime Shield* from the boss. Each stack reduces its damage taken by 10%.

Every 25%, the Elemental Source casts *Wind Gust* (icy projectiles) which makes the bonfires loose health. If a bonfire goes down, you will need to throw firewood into it and light it up again using your special action key.

With reflects and high DPS you can simply burst the boss before any bonfire expires.

After the Elemental Source is destroyed, everyone except the fastest player can `/gg` and wait for the next checkpoint at the cave to trigger. Mobility skills and <Item id="49940"/> are very good here.

## <Boss red/> Shaman Lornarr Dragonseeker <Item id="8883" text="false"/><Item id="24667" text="false"/>

<Grid>
<Column>
Stack <Boon name="might"/> before the final boss. Make sure to dodge into the boss room to avoid the ice bolts from the *Corrupted Ice Crystals* that give you <Condition name="chilled"/>.

He gains 3 stacks of *Rime Shield* reducing his incoming damage from the three respawning *Corrupted Ice Crystals*, destroy them before focusing the Shaman.

At 75%, 50% and 25% you will need to kill a summoned *Icebrood Effigy*. Basically dodge every red circle during the fight and break the defiance bars immediately to prevent mechanics.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Use <Skill id="29526"/> if you have trouble with incoming damage. <Skill id="10302"/> is also a valid option.    
        Pull all mobs together <Skill id="10363"/> whenever possible, usually when the *Icebrood Effigy* spawns.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="druid">Cast <Skill id="31496"/> against the projectiles.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist"> Use <Skill id="22572"/> for better cleave. The range of <Skill id="22572"/> is sufficient to hit the boss, the  mobs in the middle and at least one *Corrupted Ice Crystals* at the side, so make sure you aim accordingly.</Tip>

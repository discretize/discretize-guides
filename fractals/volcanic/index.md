While four people kill the respawning Grawls to fill the progress bar, one person (usually the <Specialization name="warrior"/> after placing banners) should run ahead to the next area and trigger the checkpoint at the *Grawl Shaman*. This way, everyone can `/gg` after the section is completed and resurrect to skip the Boulder passage.

## <Boss/> Grawl Shaman <Item id="8890" text="false"/><Item id="24648" text="false"/>
Kill the *Veteran Grawl Shamans* to prevent them from sacrificing the captives. Control effects like <Control name="stun"/> and <Condition name="immobile"/> hinder them from reaching the edge.

You will need to throw eight *Infused Stones* at the bubble protecting the Grawl Shaman boss to break it and make him vulnerable. The stones spawn on rockfalls, wait until the falling animation finishes and dodge into it to collect it. You can ping the Grawl Shaman (`Ctrl + T`) for easy targeting.

After the bubble is broken, stand below the boss to LoS him and he will come down immediately. Throw another *Infused Stone* at him if his bubble reappears during the fight.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">If you still have your *Mistlock Singularity*, you can place a <Skill id="10197"/> during the fight and jump down into the lava. The singularity will prevent the death from falling, keep jumping afterwards (the lava doesn't harm you if you jump repeatedly) to reach the final platform and open the portal there once the Grawl Shaman is finished. Keep in mind that you have to reach the platform before he reaches 25% health, otherwise you will die during the following cutscene.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="weaver">Use either <Skill id="5683"/> and <Skill id="5686"/> or <Skill id="5671"/> to keep the *Veteran Grawl Shamans* in your <Skill id="5548"/>, <Skill id="43762"/> and <Skill id="41125"/>.    
        If everybone LoS'ed the boss correctly, he will be close enough to <Skill id="5697"/> against the altar he stood on.</Tip>

## <Boss red/> Imbued Shaman <Item id="8886" text="false"/><Item id="24664" text="false"/>
<Grid>
<Column>
Take the shortcut on the right-hand side down to the final platform to trigger the next checkpoint, then everyone uses `/gg` to reset cooldowns. Walk until the end of the boardwalk, stack <Boon name="might"/> and jump down to the Imbued Shaman (Since the November patch, the bat follows you to the end of the walkway, but it takes here 10 or more seconds to reach it. Make sure you have the might stacked and are on the correct weapon before she flies in you firefield and brings you infight.).

Every 25% health, he gains a protective bubble and starts moving to a random villager. He will heal for about 20% health if he reaches his target, so break the bubble quickly by casting 40 offensive abilities while targeting the Imbued Shaman (you actually don't have to hit him). Try to keep him in the center as the villagers are located at the edge of the area.
    
He will also spawn 10-30 *Lava Elementals* during this phase, kill them fast as they cast a lot of projectiles and inflict high <Condition name="burning"/> stacks on the team. Note that repeated jumping prevents the application of <Condition name="burning"/> from the floor.

Avoid the *Bash* and *Wing Buffer* attacks (they <Control name="knockback"/>) and utilize conditions clears & reflects to finish the fractal successfully.

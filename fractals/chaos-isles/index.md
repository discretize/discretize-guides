## Start: You think this is Cliffside

Kill the four _Veteran Chanters_ at the beginning to open the gate on the right-hand side. The fastest person may rush ahead and move to the next checkpoint at the _Chaos Anomaly_, which involves a small jumping puzzle and kitty golems that <Control name="Knockback" /> the player off the platforms. As soon as one person reached the checkpoint, everyone else can `/gg` and resurrect at the checkpoint at the _Chaos Anomaly_.

While the video showcases the skip for <Specialization name="Thief"/> any class can execute the skip effectively with the help of blocks and reflects.

## Chaos Anomaly

<Grid>
<GridItem>

Stack <Boon name="Might"/> before the four _K1T-A golems_ and kill them to spawn the Chaos Anomaly. Every 25% health, she will become immune to damage and you have to kill K1T-A golems again to continue. With every phase there will be one less K1T-A golem but the remaining grow in strength, the final single golem at 25% health has about 1.5m health. Always the golem that gets killed last will bee eliminated.

Pay attention to the <Control name="Knockback"/> zones from the small JT-12 golems and look out for _Flux Bombs_, the debuff can be hard to notice on the mosaic ground.

<Tabs>
<Tab specialization="Revenant">

It is favorable to run <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> to be able to use <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/>. <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/> pulses <Boon name="Stability"/> which is extremely crucial to allow your party to keep on DPSing.
</Tab>

<Tab specialization="Guardian">

You can use <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> to group the little cats at the start and then every phase of Chaos Anomaly, the position you need to place yourself for perfect pull can vary based on what cat you killed last, there are variations you can't pull all of them, only 2.
</Tab>

<Tab specialization="ranger">

Run an offhand axe and use <Skill id="12638"/> to pull golems closer.

## Blizzard path (Forest)

You will need to enlighten four _bonfires_ on the path to progress to the end boss, **the _Enlighten_ charges have unlimited use so this can be soloed** but if you want to be safe simply wait for everyone.

You can stack <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip the mobs though it usually is not necessary.Learn to dodge the tentacle <Control name="Knockback"/>s. Mobility skills and <Item id="49940"/> are very good here.

## Legendary Brazen Gladiator

The end boss is only vulnerable when his protective bubble is removed by pulling him into the moving purple areas.  
He will also apply a group-wide <Control name="Daze"/> if he hits anyone with the third hit of his auto-attack chain. Avoiding this is the highest priority during the fight. Either use blocks, dodges and skills that make you invulnerable or simply do not stand in front of him when it hits. Learn to recognize the animation.

By bringing permanent <Boon name="Stability"/>, enough DPS or a dedicated healer the fight can be very easily cheesed.

Note that you can take aggro from him by walking inside his hitbox and cancel the third auto-attack by moving out before.  
Another trick is to bypass the damage from purple zones by repeated jumping.

Starting at 50% health, he will randomly start a _pulling attack_ which can be prevented by breaking his defiance bar. Save your crowd control skills for this.

Also pay attention to the small _JT-12_ golems and their AoEs as they apply <Control name="Knockback"/> and can shove you off the platform.

<Tabs>

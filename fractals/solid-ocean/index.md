## Start

You have to run to the boss first, the only obstacle in your way is your own jumping puzzle skill and the *Irukandji*, *Jade Shards*. The way to the boss is not really challenging as it can be ran through fast. If you happen to be in combat, jumping through will be a little bit harder but nothing extraordinary. Use <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip the mobs easily. Before doing the final jump onto the boss platform next to the Mistlock Singularity, make sure to have <Boon name="Swiftness"/> so you don't fall to your death because there will be <Effect name="Agony"/> applied to you mid-air.

## Jade Maw

Before you approach the boss, stack <Boon name="Might"/> and kill the two *Jade Tentacles*, then the  *Irukandji*. The *Jade Tentacles* have two skill, a huge spin AoE (so make sure to dodge it the right time) and after the spin, a stomping attack that can be side-stepped or dodged. Note that the tentacles can be CC'd like <Control name="Stun"/> or <Control name="Daze"/>.

After killing the *Jade Tentacles* new ones appear and the *Jade Maw* starts tagging players with a red skull and *Jade Colossi* starts spawning. The red skull is an indicator of an insta-downing skill which happens after the skull disappears from above the player. The skull **can be dodged when the red skull disappears** but mainly you want to **pick up the Reflecting Crystals spawned by the *Jade Colossi* and the *Jade Tentacles* and throw them into the \_Jade Maw's Eye, this is the only way it can be damaged** as normal skills won't damage him at all.

**DO NOT** kill all *Jade Tentacles* at once but move as a group from tentacle to tentacle as every tentacle cost the *Jade Maw* a small amount of HP, which however does not stack, if you kill them at the same time.

**The *Jade Colossi* spawn with a reflecting aura that can be removed using non-projectile based CC skills** such as <Control name="Stun"/> or <Control name="Daze"/>. The *Jade Colossi* has 3 skills, a far reaching skill that applies <Condition name="Crippled"/>, an AoE <Control name="Knockdown"/> and a reflecting aura that looks like <Specialization name="Elementalist"/>'s <Skill name="Magnetic Aura" profession="Elementalist"/>, the *Jade Colossus* mostly activates this aura after it got it's reflect stripped.

Constantly pick up Reflecting Crystal if you have the red skull above your head and keep doing it until the *Jade Maw* is at 5-8% HP, then he does the red skull on all 5 players in the party. All pick up a Reflecting Crystal and then you kill the *Jade Maw*. Congratulations, you finished the fractal.

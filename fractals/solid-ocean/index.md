## Start
  
You have to run to the boss first, the only obstacle in your way is your own jumping puzzle skill and the _Irukandji_, _Jade Shards_. The way to the boss is not really challenging as it can be ran through fast. If you happen to be in combat, jumping through will be a little bit harder but nothing extraordinary. Use <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip the mobs easily. Before doing the final jump onto the boss platform next to the Mistlock Singularity, make sure to have <Boon name="Swiftness"/> so you don't fall to your death because there will be <Effect name="Agony"/> applied to you mid-air.

## Jade Maw
Before you approach the boss, stack <Boon name="Might"/> and kill the two _Jade Tentacles_, then the  _Irukandji_. The _Jade Tentacles_ have two skill, a huge spin AoE (so make sure to dodge it the right time) and after the spin, a stomping attack that can be side-stepped or dodged. Note that the tentacles can be CCd like <Control name="Stun"/> or <Control name="Daze"/>.

After killing the _Jade Tentacles_ new ones appear and the _Jade Maw_ starts tagging players with a red skull and _Jade Colossi_ starts spawning. The red skull is an indicator of an insta-downing skill which happens after the skull disappears from above the player. The skull **can be dodged when the red skull disappears** but mainly you want to **pick up the Reflecting Crystals spawned by the _Jade Colossi_ and the _Jade Tentacles_ and throw them into the _Jade Maw_'s Eye, this is the only way it can be damaged** as normal skills won't damage him at all.

**DO NOT** kill all _Jade Tentacles_ at once but move as a group from tentacle to tentacle as every tentacle cost the _Jade Maw_ a small amount of HP, which however does not stack, if you kill them at the same time.

**The _Jade Colossi_ spawn with a reflecting aura that can be removed using non-projectile based CC skills** such as <Control name="Stun"/> or <Control name="Daze"/>. The _Jade Colossi_ has 3 skills, a far reaching skill that applies <Condition name="Crippled"/>, an AoE <Control name="Knockdown"/> and a reflecting aura that looks like <Specialization name="Elementalist"/>'s <Skill name="Magnetic Aura" profession="Elementalist"/>, the _Jade Colossus_ mostly activates this aura after it got it's reflect stripped. 

Constantly pick up Reflecting Crystal if you have the red skull above your head and keep doing it until the _Jade Maw_ is at 5-8% hp, then he does the red skull on all 5 players in the party. All pick up a Reflecting Crystal and then you kill the _Jade Maw_. Congratulations, you finished the fractal.

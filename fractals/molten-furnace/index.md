## Starting area and the tunnel

Go to Rox and Braham, wait for the mobs to spawn, kill them. After killing them, proceed into the tunnel, there are 5 caves in the tunnel, each having a group of mob in it, after killing the mobs, destroy the _Boulder_ that becomes damageable (a red gear indicates it's place). After killing all 5 group of mobs and destroying all 5 _Boulders_ on the red gears you wait for the Drill to make it's way out of the tunnel (which should be already done).

## On your way to the Boss

You exit the tunnel and kill the group of mobs coming to you. Then proceed to the Steam Walls. The first Steam Wall is impassable, each Steam Wall knocks you back and damages you. After the first, you can pass the following Steam Walls by walking backwards in them (do not walk into them with low HP, that downs or even kills you) or use <Boon name="Stability"/>. Make your way on to the weapon testing arena.

## Weapon Testing Arena <Label>Random</Label>

You enter the arena and survive the 3 weapon test. After entering the arena 2 Champions spawn, separate them and kill them. Not separating them results in <Boon name="Resolution"/> being applied. The weapon test types are in random order:

**Fire Tornadoes**

You have to dodge the Fire Tornadoes coming towards you. The Tornadoes apply <Condition name="Burning"/> and knock back. Please note that since the rework, the Fire Tornadoes **go through** the _Thermal Core_. After surviving the test you can damage 25% of the _Thermal Core_.

**Fireball Barrage**

You have to avoid, block or reflect the Fire Barrage falling on you, place reflect (<Specialization name="Guardian"/> with <Skill name=" Wall of Reflection"/> ) or absorb (<Specialization name="Revenant"/> <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/> with <Skill name="Protective Solace"/>) in the middle of the AoE to absorb the projectile. The AoE after the projectile landed applies <Condition name="Burning"/>. After surviving the test you can damage 25% of the _Thermal Core_.
</GridItem>

<GridItem sm="6">

**Shockwaves**

You have to dodge, block or jump over the shockwaves coming towards you. The shockwaves apply <Control name="Knockdown"/>. After surviving the test you can damage 25% of the _Thermal Core_.

**At 25% and the boss after**

You have to damage the core as fast as possible since now all 3 weapon test types are active. After you killed the _Thermal Core_ the Weapons Test Engineer and it's two champion comes down. Separate them and kill the champions on the sides. The Weapons Test Engineer gets <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> every 25%, does an AoE 10 stack <Condition name="Bleeding"/> and moves to one of the 4 spots which is the middle of the 4 walls. (It can stay where it was). It is random where he goes next. Kill him to finish the fractal.

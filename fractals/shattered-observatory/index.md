## Skorvald the Shattered
Skorvald the Shattered is the first boss in the Shattered Observatory fractal. Be sure to take the *Mistlock Singularity* after accepting the Harbringer's challenge, stack <Boon name="might"/> on the platform below and start the encounter by activating the orb in the center of the platform.

### Mechanics
| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Solar Bolt** | Skorvald often throws a red orb which splits into three after each bounce. Every orb leaves a <Condition name="burning"/> field which deals high damage. |
| **Horizon Strike** | He marks orange triangles around him and blasts them counter-clockwise which deals high damage and <Control name="knockback"/>. The orange zones themselves dont deal any damage but explode in order, practice the pattern and move into the first triangle after it is gone. Followed by Crimsown Dawn. |
| **Crimson Dawn** | Blasts the entire platform only excluding a small triangle behind him. Deals high damage.|
| **Radiant Fury** | Applies <Condition name="blind"/> and <Condition name="burning"/> to all players it hits and damages allies around them. Recognizable by diminishing red circles around every player, dodge when they collapse. Also sends out a **Solar Discharge** shockwave with <Control name="stun"/> from Skorvald. |
| **Warp & Spiral Strike** | Skorvard teleports to the target location and executes a spinning strike which damages players and applies <Control name="knockback"/>. Also sends out a volley of bolts. Noticeable by a large bomb icon above a player. |
| **Punishing Kick & Cranial Cascade** | Both attacks release a blast of chaotic mists with high damage and <Control name="knockback"/>. *Punishing Kick* generates a line in front of him, *Cranial Cascade* a cascading triangle. |
| **Focused Rage** | **Only below 66% health.** Basically a larger version of *Cranial Cascade *. Skorvald marks a player with a cross-hair and blasts a large orange cone for high damage and <Control name="knockback"/>. The marked player should turn him away from other players, during the last second of the animation he does not follow the target anymore and it is safe to step out. |
| **Solar Bloom** | **Only below 50% health.** Solar Blooms spawn on the platform which need to be knocked back by damaging them. They fixate on the closest player and explode for high area damage and <Control name="knockback"/>, keep them away from the party. |
| **Beaming Smile** | **Only below 50% health.** Skorvald teleports to a random location and summons three large and deadly laser beams. Move out to prevent instant death. He also projects a white beam onto players inflicting <Condition name="fear"/> and <Condition name="blind"/> if you face him upon triggering - simply turn away to avoid it. |
| **Solar Cyclone** | **Only below 33% health.** Skorvald starts spinning counter-clockwise and releases conical shockwaves similar to *Cranial Cascade *. There are small safe-spots between each shockwave, learn to stand inside them to avoid the high damage and interrupts. |
| **Combustion Rush** | **Only below 33% health.** Elite Flux Anomalies start charging through players and <Control name="knockback"/>, indicated by a large arrow on the platform. |

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Due to the <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> mistlock instability, run <Skill id="10267"/> for the entire fractal. Alternatively you can use <Skill id="10185"/> which also grants permanent <Boon name="protection"/> to the party upon sharing, but don't use it before a <Skill id="29830"/>, otherwise the cooldown will be too long for the next set of boons.<br/>Take <Skill id="29519"/> for the strong defiance bars.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="druid">Use the Nature Magic trait line with <Trait id="1038"/>, <Skill id="12569"/> for party <Boon name="stability"/> <33%.</Tip>
</Tips>

### Tactic
The key to the fight is fast crowd control, as breaking Skorvald's defiance bar prevents most of the mechanics. Immediately break it at the begin and bring him down to 66% health.    
At 66% and 33%, Skorvald becomes immune to damage and the party has to kill four *Elite Flux Anomalies* to proceed. They spawn on the islands in the Southwest, Southeast, Northeast and Northwest and have to be killed subsequently in that order - the party can use an air turbulence to travel between the islands. The Anomalies dont have much health (170k) but knock players back with shockwaves. Pay attention to the emotes and position yourself between the Anomaly and a wall.

It is worth placing a <Item id="78978"/> portal on the main platform and opening it immediately after the 4th Anomaly is dead to deal more damage to Skorvald before he continues his attacks, especially at 33%.

Below 33% health, Skorvald goes berserk and starts his *Solar Cyclone* attack. Practice the safe spots and keep the *Solar Blooms* away from the party, a Druid is the perfect candidate for this job with staff autoattack, but a Berserker Warrior can also help with Longbow F1. After about 30 seconds, Skorvald starts a huge laser beam attack (*Beaming Smile*) and regains his defiance bar, if he is not dead yet break the bar and finish him.

---

## Intermediate part
After Skorvald is dead, take the portal to the East and take the left portal in the control center area. You can activate a <Item id="78786"/> to walk during the cutscene and save some time.

You gain a new special action key: `Nova Launch`. For the moment, it is a 2100-range teleport with stunbreak that blocks the next attack (1.75s <Boon name="aegis"/>). Its cooldown refreshes after you bounce a *Globolla Marble*.

You will encounter several glass mobs on the way to the second boss, there are no differences to the regular Shattered Observatory. After the first group of mobs, you will have to bounce a white *Globolla Marble* nine times with your head to progress. If you have a spare <Item id="78978"/> or <Item id="44642"/>, you can skip directly to Artsarriv using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBvKQu9EqEc" rel="external">this cut</a>, otherwise use your `Nova Launch` to jump to <a href="/_/img/fractals/so-shortcut.jpg">this platform</a> and kill the elite mob there to proceed to Artsariiv.

---

## Artsariiv
The second boss of the fractal is Artsariiv. The encounter gets activated by bouncing a *Globolla Marble* into her, be sure to prepare <Boon name="might"/> and skills in the northwest beforehand.

Artsariiv summons copies which split into smaller clones upon death, they use martial art skills, <Control name="knockdown"/>, shoot shocking projectiles and apply a lot of damaging conditions. Discuss whether you kill all adds (safe tactic) or not.    
Assign a player for the *Globolla Marble* bouncing and a backup in case the main bouncer gets *Corporal Reassignment*.

You will need a lot of crowd control skills, consumables like <Item id="8759"/> and <Item id="8678"/> are very strong here.    
**Use your `Nova Launch`` special action key to quickly move around the platform, the <Boon name="aegis"/> from it counters nearly all mechanics.**

### Mechanics
| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Beaming Smile** | Similar to Skorvald below 50% health, Artsariiv generates three large laser beams and projects a white beam onto players which inflicts high damage, <Condition name="blind"/> and <Condition name="fear"/>. Turn away from the source to prevent application. |
| **Astral Surge** | Artsariiv spawns a lot of small point blank area of effects (PBAoE) on the ground which deal medium damage, try to stay out of them when the inner circle reaches the outer. |
| **Corporal Reassignment** | Designates a player for timed explosion, recognizable by a red skull above the target and a large notification message. The player must seek containment inside the white bubble in the center area or will kill himself and allies.<br/>The white bubble is only available after the respawning **Temporal Anomaly** is killed.<br/> *This is the highest priority for any damage dealer.* |
| **Solar Discharge** | From time to time, Artsariiv switches her location and moves to another corner. When doing so, she jumps over the platform and emerges a single *Solar Discharge* shockwave which applies <Control name="knockdown"/>. This ability can be jumped over. |
| **Red Marble** | Artsariiv throws a lot of red orbs during the fight, watch out for a large *Red Marble* surrounded by red orbs - it deals <Control name="knockdown"/> and deals medium damage. Unfortunately reacting in close melee range is nearly impossible. You can utilize reflects against the various orbs. |
| **Slam** | Deals <Control name="knockback"/> and deals damage in a short range around Artsariiv. Recognizable by an orange circle around her, simply dodge it. |
| **Mib Ring** | Artsariiv herself and all her clones during the intermediate phases create a purple miasma field inside their hitboxes, dont stand too close to avoid damage. |
| **Globolla Marble** | **Only below 66% health.** Artsariiv throws a huge, white *Globolla Marble * which needs to be bounced back to her. The next position of the marble is always indicated by a large white circle, the next but one position by a smaller white circle.<br/>Use `Nova Launch` to travel between the locations as it refreshes after each bounce. Usually the Warrior soloes this mechanic, but other players should keep an eye on it and serve as a backup in case the main bouncer gets *Corporal Reassignment*.

### Tactic
Immediately after the fight starts, Artsariiv channels her huge triple-laser attack *Beaming Smile* (similar to Skorvald at low health). Do not get caught within those lasers or you die and turn away from her to prevent <Condition name="blind"/> and <Condition name="fear"/>.    
Kill the first *Temporal Anomaly* to spawn a containment for *Corporal Reassignment* and cleave the first set of clones. When you feel safe enough, move northwest to Artsariiv, break her defiance bar and bring her down to 66% health.

At 66% and 33% health, Artsariiv splits up into five and nine clones respectively. Those clones can't be damaged and only despawn when their defiance bar is broken. All party members get resurrected afterwards, so don't waste time on dead players.    
The central clone has the highest priority as it shoots additional damaging orbs. Also pay attention to the single *Globolla Marble* during the CC phase, if it isn't bounced it deals medium damage to the party.

After the CC phases are over, Artsariiv reappears in the middle of the platform and conjures an *Obliterate* attack and multiple orange void zones which need to be dodged. She also does her *Beaming Smile* attack similar to the start of the fight. Kill the respawned *Temporal Anomaly* and clones (optional) before switching to her again.

Below 66% health, Artsariiv throws a large *Globolla Marble* from time to time which needs to be bounced back to her over nine locations. Failing to bounce usually results in a party wipe, choose a reliable player beforehand to solo this.

After the fight is over, take the portal in the North and move forward to get to Arkk.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Try to at least summon a <Skill id="10267"/> before you leave for marble bouncing.<br/>Time your invulnerables for *Slam* and remember your many crowd control skills for the intermediate phases.<br/>From here on, you can use `Nova Launch` immediately before sharing boons to spread <Boon name="aegis"/> and prevent dangerous boss mechanics.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="druid">Use <Skill id="31496"/> against the multitude of projectiles. Like the orb attacks on start from the two elites on start and from Artsariiv before her Slam attack.</Tip>
</Tips>

## Arkk
Arkk is the third and final boss of the fractal. An attentive player may have noticed the `Nova Launch` special action key became even stronger now, doing medium damage, a 200 <Control name="launch"/> and executing a Blast finisher. Thanks to this, other crowd control skills are negligible for this fight.    
In contrast to the other enemies in the fractal, Arkk belongs to Scarlet's army and <Item id="50082"/> works against him.

Arkk himself has no melee attacks, but a lot of abilities which can make the fight rather chaotic for inexperienced groups. However, all damage can be avoided and therefore a healer is not mandatory. More party DPS means less boss mechanics.    
Stack <Boon name="might"/> (you can use `Nova Launch`) and renew your *Mistlock Singularity* before activating the orb to teleport to Arkk.

### Mechanics
| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Blinding Radiance** | Similar to the other bosses, Arkk has the white beam ability which damages players facing him and inflicts <Condition name="blind"/> and <Condition name="fear"/>. It is easily recognizable by a large eye icon above Arkk. If you have problems receiving damage despite looking away, try to wiggle left/right while turned away to minimize the risk. |
| **Solar Fury & Solar Discharge** | Arkk prepares this ability by conjuring a large red orb above his head. When the orbs disappears (after ~4 seconds), he launches bouncing orbs towards every player, leaving a <Condition name="burning"/> fire field after each bounce. At the same time, he emerges a stunning *Solar Discharge* shockwave which needs to be dodged or jumped over.<br/>The orbs from this attack can and should be **reflected** to prevent the fire zones on the floor from spawning. |
| **Corporal Reassignment** | The same mechanic as on Artsariiv. Designates a player for timed explosion, the party has to kill a **Temporal Anomaly** (56k life) to spawn a containment for the target. |
| **Temporal Realignment** | Similar to the green circle mechanic on *Vale Guardian*. Designates a player to take 80% of their health in damage, split between any nearby allies. Try to have at least three players inside the green circle but be careful with <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/>. If no other player is inside the circle upon collapsing, it detonates the whole party. |
| **Focused Rage** | Similar to Skorvald, Arkk marks a player with a crosshair and blasts the area with damage and a <Control name="knockback"/>. If you are marked, turn Arkk away from the other party members *and* the white containment bubble and move out during the last second of the animation. |
| **Horizon Strike & Diffractive Edge** | Again, a mechanic taken from Skorvald. Arkk marks orange triangles around him and blasts them counter-clockwise. The first triangle is always the first to be blasted.<br/>*Diffractive Edge* is basically the same ability, it just blasts all triangles at the same time but leaves a small safe spot behind Arkk. |
| **Starburst Cascade** | **Only below 60% health.** Arkk sends out a wave of cascading energy across the platform, applying <Control name="float"/> to every player caught inside. This ability can be jumped over. |
| **Disappearing Platforms** | **Only below 40% health.** In the final phase of the fight, random platforms temporarily disappear. If you fall through the ground, you will get teleported to above and start falling down - use your `Nova Launch` to get back into the fight. |
| **Solar Stomp** | **Only below 40% health.** Arkk vanishes in dust evading all attacks, when he reappears he stomps the ground, damages nearby enemies, executes a <Control name="knockback"/> and sends out a volley of bolts. Be careful to not let it push you off the platform. |
| **Rolling Chaos** | **Only below 40% health.** Recognizable by a small red arrow emanating from Arkk. Launches a rolling red marble in the designated direction which deals high damage. |
| **Beaming Smile / DDR** | **Only below 30% health.** Similar to the previous bosses, Arkk summons three large laser beams while simultaneously projecting the white beams onto players. Move out and turn away. |

### Tactic
Immediately when the fight starts, turn away as Arkk uses his *Blinding Radiance* ability. Always prioritize the respawning *Temporal Anomalies*, you only have a short time window to kill them before the player designated for *Corporal Reassignment* explodes.    
A lot of the mechanics can occur at the same time, practice to avoid every single one.    
Before triggering the Solar Bloom phases, you might want to wait for another Temporal Anomaly/Corporal Reassignment combination to prevent chaos during the intermediate phase.

#### Solar Blooms *80%, 50%, 30%*
When Arkk reaches 80% health, he gains <Effect name="invulnerability"/> and players have to kite four *Solar Blooms* into the pillars in the corners to destroy them.    
A common strategy is to assign four players to the spawning locations in the North, East, South and West, as the Solar Blooms fixate on the closest player a few seconds after their spawn. Players take aggro of their designated Solar Bloom and kite them clockwise to the next pillar on the right. You can also use direct damage skills to push back the Blooms.    
The fifth, remaining player should be a DPS ready to take out a possibly spawning *Temporal Anomaly* during the phase. This player must also be ready to join the player with the green circle.    
After every Solar Bloom phase, Arkk's defiance bar has to be broken immediately or he kills all players. Use your `Nova Launch` ability for an additional <Control name="launch"/> if you are short on crowd control skills.

#### Elite Bosses *70%, 40%*
At 70% and 40% of Arkk's health, the party gets teleported to another dimension where you have to fight the *Elite Archdiviner* from the Cliffside fractal and the *Elite Brazen Gladiator* from the Chaos fractal respectively.    
Both bosses behave similar to their real version and are surrounded by four mobs (Cultists/Golems). Try to kill the adds before finishing the boss as they follow you back to Arkk. Remember the party-wide <Control name="daze"/> if the third auto-attack of the Gladiator hits someone.

#### Final phase *<40%*
Below 40% health, random platforms start disappearing temporarily. Due to this mechanic, space is very limited and resurrecting a downed player is nearly impossible.
Sometimes *Temporal Anomalies* spawn on vanished platforms which makes the fight even more challenging.    
The most important thing is to keep calm. Remember that every single ability can be avoided, reflect and jump over the *Solar Fury* orbs, jump or dodge through the *Starburst Cascade* and *Solar Stomp *attacks, turn away from the *Blinding Radiance* and move accordingly to the *Horizon Strike* pattern. If you dont have any dodges left, use your `Nova Launch` skill to counter mechanics. Keep a cool head and finish the fight!

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Trait <Trait id="751"/> and place <Skill id="10186"/> inside Arkk to reflect the orbs from *Solar Fury*. You can alternate between reflects and invulnerables to completely negate mechanics. Remembed to use `Nova Launch` immediately before sharing boons to spread <Boon name="aegis"/> and bypass mechanics like *Solar Fury*.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Use <Skill id="14184"/> against the *Solar Orbs*.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="firebrand">Use <Skill id="9251"/> against the orbs.<br/>Killing a *Temporal Anomaly* or any of the Elite Boss adds recharges your <Skill id="44364"/>.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="druid">You can consider running a more defensive setup with <Trait id="12495"/> for <Boon name="protection"/> from spirits.</Tip>

## Start & Ankle Seals <Item id="8881" disableText/><Item id="24678" disableText/>

Kill the Cultists but take the _Cultist Hammer_ before finishing the last one to get a hammer charge.

Take the portal to above (...or walk) and destroy the two _Ankle Seals_ using hammer `Skill 4`. Both seals have to get hit two times, do not finish mobs unless you need a charge.

Use `/gg` afterwards and stay dead until the <Specialization name="Elementalist"/>, <Specialization name="Guardian"/>, <Specialization name="Thief"/> reaches the Chest Seal.

## Chest Seal <Item id="8881" disableText/><Item id="24678" disableText/>

As soon as the <Specialization name="Elementalist"/> did `/gg` too, everyone can resurrect and will respawn in front of the _Chest Seal_ with a new _Cultist Hammer_ ahead of you.

It will take five hits to break the chest seal. If you see somebody running ahead and placing a <Item name="whitemantleportaldevice"/> to the _Arm Seals_, try to get a hammer charge before taking it to above.

## Arm Seals <Item id="8881" disableText/><Item id="24678" disableText/>

This is a matter of timing, so look out for the <Item id="78978"/> and the hammer carrier. In a perfect world yoe use the portals one by one, and <Specialization name="Renegade"/> placing <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/>, giving <Boon name="Stability"/> to the hammer carrier and not getting knocked back, resulting in faster seal breaking.

During the portal jumping, keep Cultist's health as low as possible but **only finish them when a hammer charge is needed**. If you run out of portals simply run together. Ideally, both seals take three hits to be destroyed—two portals are more than enough.

Type `/gg` after finishing both seals and stay dead. If you wipe before both seals are destroyed, they will reset to full health.

## The way up

Do not resurrect yourself yet, wait for the <Specialization name="Revenant"/>, <Specialization name="Elementalist"/>, <Specialization name="Guardian"/> or <Specialization name="Thief"/> to finish his portal and do `/gg` himself again or you will be stuck with a useless person for the entire end fight.

After the whole party `/gg`'ed, resurrect yourself and place <Item id="78978"/> at the revival position.  
Blink up to the Arch Diviner, open the portal and **walk away from it** before doing `/gg` again to reset your cooldowns. If you kill yourself on the portal it bugs so watch it!

Now the whole party can resurrect and use the portal, type `go` in chat to indicate that. Before taking the portal on your own, switch your skills and traits back. This takes some timing to get right.

## Arch Diviner <Item id="8881" disableText/><Item id="24678" disableText/>

After the portal opens you resurrect, take the portal up and start the fight against the Arch Diviner. His defiance bar appears very shortly but frequently, try to break it as often as possible to benefit from <Trait id="1502"/>.

Every 25% of his health, you will need to collect a _Cultist Hammer_ charge similar to before by killing one of the four spawned Cultists and hit the final Seal to make the Arch Diviner vulnerable again. Cultists apply a lot of conditions so kill them fast and try to stay out of their aggro range.

Do not get caught in any of the Arch Diviner's voidzones, otherwise you will be teleported and trapped inside a distant cage which messes up positioning. Also, try to stack on him as he teleports to the furthermost person.

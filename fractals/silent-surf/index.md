## Spelunking

Insert something about the kit, link the skills (might need to add them to discretizeui if they arent in the gw2 api).

On entering the fractal you will meet Captain Thess. Near to Thess is a box of leftover supplies. Interacting with this will give you access to a bundle using your special action key, giving you access to the followng skills:
- <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1)
- <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2)
- <Skill name="Black Powder Charge"/> (Skill 3)
- <Skill name="Flare"/> (SKill 5)

You will need to use these skills to progress through the cave, however, be careful since these skills are ammunition based. As you progress through the fractal you will encounter more leftover supplies to replenish ammunition. As you move through each section, Thress will open up portals behind you to allow you to return to previous areas, or any slower party members to skip forward and catch up. Additionally, if you fall, you will be ported to the last checkpoint by Thess for another attempt. Also by using <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1), or <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2), or landing directly on a bouncing mushroom, you will negate any fall damage when landing on platforms.

<Information>
There are multiple ways to progress through the "jumping puzzle" section of this fractal. It is not necessary to follow the skill usage below, especially if going for the Peace and Quiet achievement!
</Information>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
### First Drop

Interacting with the first box of leftover supplies will provide you with a <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/>. When you are ready jump into the hole and use <Skill name="Parachute"/> (skill 2) to safely land at the bottom, triggering the first checkpoint.

### Zipline

At the bottom you will find a second box giving you <Skill name="Grappling Hook" text="1 Grappling Hook"/> amd <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/>. Use the <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (skill 1) to grapple to the platform in front of you and take the zipline to the platform below. Take the next zipline, which will dismount you at the end and send you falling towards the ground. Use <Skill name="Parachute"/> (skill 2) to break your fall. 

When ready stand in the white circle (you need at least two playsers in this circle for the fractal to continue). With enough players in the circle, a short event will spawn requiring you to fend off an attack from some bats and spiders. Fending off the attack will trigger the second checkpoint and Thess will open a portal that can be used to travel back through the fractal.

### Bouncing Mushrooms

The third box of leftover supplies will give you <Skill name="Grappling Hook" text="1 Grappling Hook"/>, <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/>, and <Skill name="Black Powder Charge" text="1 Black Powder Charge"/>. Looking over the edge of the platform you will see some large bouncing mushrooms below.

Jump down onto the mushrooms (as long as you hit them you will not take fall damage) and as you get flung into the air use <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (skill 1) on the  large Stalactite in the center of the cavern. If required, you can then use <Skill name="Black Powder Charge"/> (skill 3) to boost yourself forward to land on the ground infront of you. Use the Wind Cannon to get boosted up to the next platform.

Like the last section, you need at least two players to stand in the white circle on the platform to progress the fractal. This starts the event clear out the Naga raiders. Once dealt with the third checkpoint will trigger and Thess will open up another portal.
</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="6">
### Wind Cannons

On the platform is another box of leftover supplies. This box gives you <Skill name="Grappling Hook" text="3 Grappling Hooks"/>, <Skill name="Parachute" text="2 Parachutes"/>, and <Skill name="Black Powder Charge" text="1 Black Powder Charge"/>. When ready enter the next Wind Cannon, which weill shoot you onto a zupline above. At the end of the zipline you will be dismounted and fall towards more bouncing mushrooms (if you need, use a <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1) or <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2) charge to adjust your course). The mushrooms will send you into another Wind Cannon leaving you on another ledge.

In the distance below, you will see some bouncing mushrooms, make your way over to them using the bundle skills you have available. These bouncing mushrooms will send you into another Wind Cannon, onto a zipline, which will again dismount you at the end, sending you falling to the ground below. Use a <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> (Skill 1) or <Skill name="Parachute"/> (Skill 2) charge to survive the landing.

Once again, have two players stand in the white circle to progress the fractal triggering the final checkpoint. Thess will arive and open a final portal and the "Survive the corrupted ambushers" event begins. Once the ambush has been survived, you will remain in combat until you have fought Corrupted

## Corrupted First Mate Dolus

Corrupted First Mate Dolus is a simple fight that has two main mechanics. When Dolus appears he is untargatable while he does his first attack, Dread Visage. A large eye will appear above his head, when you see this turn your character model to face away to avoid getting <Condition name="Fear" text="Feared"/>. Thess will be knocked off the platform and the fight will begin.

Dolus will now be targetable and start casting Frightening Speed (the numbers attack). Each player will be marked with a number and get an expanding AoE around them. Spread out making sure to not stand in another players circle and after a short period Dolus will dash to each player in ascending order attacking them.  Dolus has a small defiance bar, which when broken will <Control name="Stun"/> him, cancelling his current attack and in higher dps groups, allow you to stack and ignore the numbers mechanic, killing Dolus before he has a chance to cast anything else.

Once you have finished the fight, take the _Mistlock Singularity_ to reset your cooldowns, interact with the box of leftover supplies which will give you <Skill name="Parachute" text="1 Parachute"/> and jump off the edge to find the final boss platform. If you need to go back through the fractal for any reason, before jumping feel fee to take the portal which will take you back to previous checkpoints.

Similar to Sunqua Peak, at the start you interact with the Challenge Mote to spawn a portal, which will take you directly to the platform where you fight First Mate Dolus. After triggering the circle, a small group of Naga will spawn and then Captain Thess will say a few lines before Dolus spawns similar to Normal Mode. 

Do not take the mistlock before triggering the circle! This way you can use all your long cooldowns to kill Dolus quickly and reset them before fighting Kanaxai.

Also known as the fear attack. A large eye will appear over the bosses head and any Aspects that are on the platform.

<Tab title="Frightening Speed">
<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
Also known as the numbers attack. Every player and the boss will get an orange AoE around them, and the plavers will get a random number. Spread out so you are not standing in another AoE and anfter a short period of time the boss will jump to each player and attack in numerical order. After attacking the players  the boss will return back to its original position and do one final attack, after which it is safe to return to melee range. If you stand in another players, or the bosses final AoE, and the boss attacks you will be killed instantly. When the boss attacks it deals a large amount of damage, based upon your total health, this can be avoided by moving quickly away out of range or by using a blink.

_Note: Be mindful on days with instabilities such as <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/> and <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/>, since the fields left by these instabilities will cause you to take a lot of 
unnecessary damage during this mechanic if you do not move out of them!_

There isn't much to this fight. Most groups should be able to break Dolus' bar quickly and burst him down before he can do anything, but if the CC is not high enough you can just spread out and do the mechanics.

## Kanaxai, Scythe of House Aurkus
<Label>34,124,184 HP</Label>
<Achievement title="Defiance Demolisher ">
Accept the harbinger's challenge and defeat the final boss while he has ten or more stacks of Dread Defiance. 
</Achievement>

This fight has similar mechanics to Normal Mode but they're all more punishing. The overall damage pressure is fairly high &mdash; the numbers mechanic (_Frightening Speed_) deals 50% of each players' HP and the boss deals high amounts of <Condition name="torment"/> and <Condition name="bleeding"/> to any players hit by the bosses auto attack. That means your group needs to be ready to share heals right after splitting up and condition cleanses can be very useful, especially on days with <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/>, <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/>, and <Instability name="Afflicted"/>. Additionally, failing certain mechanics or falling off the platform leads to instant death or a party wipe.

It is considered a condition-favored encounter because the fight is divided into relatively long phases and that allows condition builds, which generally have the higher benchmarks in the current balance, to ramp-up. Another consideration is that some of these builds have easier access to self sustain and damage mitigation without large tradeoffs when compared to power builds.

The same reasoning determines that builds with access to ranged attacks should perform better as it's possible to keep DPS uptime while dropping _Axes_, staying out of the _Boonstrip_ fields, and spreading out before _Frightening Speed_.

Getting hit by this attack will also strip all of the players boons and transfer them to the boss.

_Note: This attack cannot be mitigated in any way. The only way to avoid this attack is to leave the AoE before the projectile hits. Dodging, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, or skills that apply <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> will not block the attack!_

### Details
The fight will start by interacting with the body of Captain Thess on the ground, placing the group in combat. Use the time until Kanaxai spawns and becomes vulnerable to precast any skills and position yourself around the boss ready to attack. Once vulnerable, Kanaxai will start with Frightening Speed, so slowly move out while still attacking ready to deal with the mechanic. As soon as the mechanic is over with, Kanaxai will then cast Dread Visage so make sure you are ready to face your character model away from the boss and the Aspects.

At 90% HP, Kanaxai will gain a CC bar that is vulnerable for 5 seconds. Breaking it will apply <Effect name="Exposed"/> for 5 seconds. Every time the CC bar is broken Kanaxai will gain a stack of <Effect name="Dread Defiance"/> each stack will incoming defiance damage and <Effect name="Exposed"/> duration by 20.5% multiplicatively. Depending on how fast you kill the boss or how many bars you choose to break, <Effect name="Dread Defiance"/> will stack up to 10 stacks, with the following defiance bar values:
  
  1st - 1200, 2nd - 1510, 3rd - 1900, 4th - 2390, 5th - 3000, 6th - 3780, 7th - 4750, 8th - 5980, 9th - 7520, 10th - 9460

The CC bars do not regenerate on this encounter, so if a bar is not broken in time, any damage done will cary ovver to the next time the bar is vulnerable. Kanaxai's defiance bar can be vulnerable at the following health percentages providing Kanaxai is not doing another mechanic (if the groups damage is high you will skip some of these bars due to mechanic and phase timings): 

  90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15% and 10%. 

During the time the CC bar is up, Kanaxai gains the effect <Effect name="Gathering Shadows"/>. If the bar is not broken, Kanaxai will spawn an Aspect on the edge of the platform. In later phases this can be taken advantage of to gain the <Effect name="Phantasmagoria"/> effect.

<Card title="World Cleaver">
<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
The boss will move to the center of the platform and gain <Effect name="Invulnerability"/>. The Aspects will target the closest players with an orange tether, applying the <Effect name="Phantasmagoria"/> effect until killed, and giving the player two charges of <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/>. After a few seconds the Aspect will move to an island signified by a blue beam of light and will now be targatable. All players that can see an Aspect will need to <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> to their respective islands and kill their Aspect before the orange AoE in the center of the platform fills. If the party kills all of the Aspects in time the boss will attack applying <Effect name="Agony"/> then become vulnerable again. If any Aspects remain the party will wipe.

_Note: The tether from an aspect to a player can be intercepted by a player standing in the tether. This can delay the Aspects moving to an island making it in some cases hard to kill in time. It is advisable unless you know what you are doing to not take tethers from other players. Additionally having <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Effect name="Invulnerability"/>, or blocking will also delay the tether._

_When using <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/>, make sure to aim towards the rear of the island to gain enough height in the air to land. On the taller islands you can easily not get enough height and hit the side instead causing you to fall to your death and the party to wipe!_

Also known as the Island Fear. This version of Dread Visage is almost the same as the mechanic in the first phase, however this time the boss will teleport to an Island when doing the fear. Once again face your characters model away from the boss and any Aspects to avoid being Feared off the platform, and after the attack the boss will return. Once again being hit by this attack will apply <Condition name="Fear"/>, <Effect name="Agony"/>, <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Torment"/> and being hit for 35% of your maximum health. Additionally, being hit by this attack will give you <Effect name="Extreme Vulnerability"/>, meaning if you get hit by multiple fears, you will be killed instantly.

<GridItem sm="6">
Also known as the tether attack. During Dread Visage at least one Aspect will instead tether the closest player, the same as the World Cleaver mechanic. This will apply the <Effect name="Phantasmagoria"/> effect applying a debuff reducing incoming and increasing outgoing damage by 50%, lasting 30 seconds or until the Aspect is killed, and giving the player two charges of <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/>. After a few seconds the Aspect will move to an island signified by a blue beam of light and will now be targatable and attack the group until killed or despwans after 30 seconds. The player that can see an Aspect will need to <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/> to the island and kill the Aspect which will remove the <Effect name="Phantasmagoria"/> effect.

_Note: When using <Skill name="Grappling Hook"/>, make sure to aim towards the rear of the island to gain enough height in the air to land. On the taller islands you can easily not get enough height and hit the side instead causing you to fall to your death and the party to wipe!_

_The <Effect name="Phantasmagoria"/> effect description is incorrect and will actually increase affected players outgoing strike and condition damage by 50%, instead of reducing it. This means in groups that can cope with the increased damage pressure it is beneficial to make sure the DPS players intercept the tether and to ignore the Aspect to deal significantly more damage._

This attack is a combination of Frightening Speed and Dread Visage. It is handled in exactly the same way as earlier in the fight. Every player needs to spread out, except this time once the boss starts attacking, face their character model towards the islands to avoid being struck by <Condition name="Fear"/>. Being struck is especially dangerous due to the chance of running into a neighbouring players AoE and being killed by Kanaxai, as well as falling off the platform to your death.

If you are hit, once again using a stun break or having <Boon name="Stability"/> or <Boon name="Resistance"/> will save you providing you can face away from the boss quickly and don't run into another players AoE as the boss attacks them.

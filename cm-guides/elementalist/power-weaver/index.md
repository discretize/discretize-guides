This version is made mostly for PuGs that are not phasing fast enough to get profit from <Skill id="44612"/>. If group is good you can follow the organised rotation and just add <Skill id="5687"/> at start of the boss for cc (it will be up for phase 3). Precast <Skill id="40183"/> for 1 tick in <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> at the beginning of each phase.

<Warning>
This build only works if you kill Siax in less than 55 seconds. If there is any doubt about the kill time, go with the PuG version.
</Warning>

In more organised groups it's recommended to run <Specialization name="Tempest"/>+<Skill name="conjurelightninghammer"/> precast to get extra phase 2 DPS and better <Boon name="Quickness"/>/<Boon name="Fury"/> uptime after the <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> changes (especially if you want to run with <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> instead of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>).
</Boss>

### **Precast**

-   Precast <Skill id="5624"/> for yourself and <Skill id="5567"/>  for <Specialization name="Renegade"/> close to the boss hitbox


### **1st Phase**

-   Precast <Skill id="43803"/> when boss is pulled

-   <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/> -> <Skill id="44451"/> -> Pick up LH -> <Skill id="5733"/> for CC -> <Skill id="5725"/> -> Attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> with remaining <Skill id="44612"/> uptime.

-   When boss is at 68-66% throw <Skill id="5516"/> in the middle of boss hitbox.


### *1st Add*

-   Jump at add with your <Skill id="5517"/> and after damaging it move towards the Siax.

-   Precast <Skill id="5531"/> and <Skill id="5737"/> on boss hitbox

-   **NOTE:** If there is <Instability name="Vengeance"/> or <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and adds have <Boon name="Protection"/> it's recommended to use <Skill id="5697"/> from adds back to move towards siax and provide more help for guardian with killing echo. You have to be **very** fast in that phase otherwise you will loose a lot of your phase 2 burst.


### **2nd Phase**

-   It's the most important part for you as <Specialization name="weaver"/>. You have to be as fast as possible to get proper burst in <Effect name="Exposed"/> after changes ( 4s <Effect name="Exposed"/> duration ).

-   <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/>-><Skill id="44451"/>->  <Skill id="5557"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/> -> auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> -> Attune back to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> with remaining <Skill id="44612"/>

-   When boss is about 36-33% pick up <Skill id="5516"/>.

-   **NOTE:** Be careful with tether mechanic to not blow up your allies. If you are fast and have a close eye on others echos it's possible to precast <Skill id="43803"/> and use <Skill id="5691"/>-> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5557"/> priority to get full <Effect name="Exposed"/> dmg and additional <Trait id="1510"/> stacks from tethers, but you have to be insanely fast.


### *2nd Add*

-   <Skill id="5517"/> to add, use few autos from your <Skill id="5516"/> and <Skill id="5697"/> through the echo back to boss.

-   If you have troubles with that part you can use 1-2 ticks from <Skill id="40183"/> to give deal some additional <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on add.

-   Precast <Skill id="5531"/> on Siax.


### **3rd Phase**

-   <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/>-> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/> -> auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> -> <Skill id="5557"/> -> Attune back to <Skill id="5494"/> for additional dmg from <Trait id="222"/>

-   If timers are slow you will be able to skip auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> for <Skill id="5557"/> instantly.

-   **NOTE:** Do not hesitate to use <Skill id="40709"/>, <Skill id="46447"/>, <Skill id="44405"/> if things are going hot. Just keep in mind that you have to be on <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> just as phase starts.

</Boss>

### **Precast**

-   Precast <Skill id="5624"/> behind boss hitbox (on edge of it, sligthly left to not get cucked with marbles during picking it up, watch any PoV for more input ). /gg or use portal to get back to *Mistlock Singularity*.

-   **NOTE:** You can use tempest precast as well if any party member is placing fire field.


### **Precast on boss**

It's not that easy precast and opener, it's recommended to check any PoV before using it.

-   Precast <Skill id="5531"/> when orb is about to hit the ground and boss will be triggered. It's about 0.5-0.8 second.

-   Fully precast <Skill id="5501"/> and attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/>. Swap your weapons during cast time.

-   Precast <Skill id="5737"/>


### **Phase 1**

-   If you feel confident with timers precast <Skill id="43803"/>, it should be precasted instantly after <Skill id="5737"/> when precast is executed properly.

-   <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> dodge to the LH to not get hit by death ray -> pick up LH -> <Skill id="5725"/> -> drop LH -> <Skill id="5557"/> -> cast <Skill id="44451"/> and jump over knocking wave during cast time while following boss -> <Skill id="45313"/> to boss.

-   If boss is still not phased continue with BTTH rota until it's phased.


### **Split 1**

-   CC your add with <Skill id="5687"/>.

-   You can use <Skill id="5529"/> to get back to center faster for p2.


### **Phase 2**

-   Both in p2 and p3 try to precast  <Skill id="43803"/> to get faster burst.

-   <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> autochain -> dodge deathwave -> <Skill id="5557"/> -> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/>

-   Blast fire field with <Skill id="21656"/>

-   Start attuning to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> as fast as possible

-   <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> auto chain -> <Skill id="44451"/>

-   Don't use <Skill id="5691"/>, save it for pre p3 blast.

-   Stay in <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5492"/>

-   Cast <Skill id="5691"/> for blasts.

-   Attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/>

-   CC the add with <Skill id="44998"/>+<Skill id="5687"/>

-   Throw your <Skill id="5516"/> for your <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> close to the middle.

-   <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> autochain -> dodge deathwave -> <Skill id="5557"/> -> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/>

-   If boss is still not killed use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to get to the corner and just finish it with normal BTTH rota execution.

-   **NOTE:** In organized groups you should block/burn Rigorous Certainty on deathwave to not loose DPS by dodging it in middle.

This version is made mostly for PuGs that are not phasing fast enough to get profit from <Skill id="44612"/>. If group is good you can follow the organised rotation and just add <Skill id="5687"/> at start of the boss for cc (it will be up for phase 3).

</Boss>

### **Precast**

Equip your Sword/Dagger and attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> before the <Skill id="5501"/> animation finishes and start the boss!

### **Phase 2:** 

- <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> auto chain 
 -> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/> -> <Skill id="5557"/>

### **Phase 3:** 
- When the knight is about to die move towards the boss (be careful with damaging fields!).
- <Skill id="5687"/> as fast as the boss is vulnerable for quick CC.

 -> <Skill id="5557"/>-> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/> 
- Start attuning to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> to be ready for phase 4.

<Message>
This build only works if you kill MAMA in less than 55 seconds. If there is any doubt about the kill time, go with the PuG version. The following guide assumes you are following the proposed [CC-Distribution](/guides/cc-distribution).
</Message>

In more organised groups its recommended to run <Specialization name="Tempest"/>+<Skill name="conjurelightninghammer"/> precast to get extra phase 2 DPS and better <Boon name="Quickness"/>/<Boon name="Fury"/> uptime after the <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> changes (especially if you want to run with <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> instead of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>).

This build only works if you kill Siax in less than 55 seconds. If there is any doubt about the kill time, go with the PuG version.

</Boss>

### **Precast**
- Precast <Skill id="5624"/> for yourself and <Skill id="5567"/>  for <Specialization name="Renegade"/> close to the boss hitbox

### **1st Phase**
- Precast <Skill id="43803"/> when boss is pulled
- <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/> -> <Skill id="44451"/> -> Pick up LH -> <Skill id="5733"/> for CC -> <Skill id="5725"/> -> Attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> with remaining <Skill id="44612"/> uptime. 
- When boss is at 68-66% throw <Skill id="5516"/> in the middle of boss hitbox.

### _1st Add_
- Jump at add with your <Skill id="5517"/> and after damaging it move towards the Siax.
- Precast <Skill id="5531"/> and <Skill id="5737"/> on boss hitbox
- **NOTE:** If there is <Instability name="Vengeance"/> or <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and adds have <Boon name="Protection"/> its recommended to use <Skill id="5697"/> from adds back to move towards siax and provide more help for guardian with killing echo. You have to be **very** fast in that phase otherwise you will loose a lot of your phase 2 burst. 


### **2nd Phase**
- Its the most important part for you as <Specialization name="weaver"/>. You have to be as fast as possible to get proper burst in <Effect name="Exposed"/> after changes ( 4s <Effect name="Exposed"/> duration ).
- <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/>

- When boss is about 36-33% pick up <Skill id="5516"/>.
- **NOTE:** Be careful with tether mechanic to not blow up your allies. If you are fast and have a close eye on others echos its possible to precast <Skill id="43803"/> and use <Skill id="5691"/>-> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5557"/> priority to get full <Effect name="Exposed"/> dmg and additional <Trait id="1510"/> stacks from tethers, but you have to be insanely fast.
### _2nd Add_
- <Skill id="5517"/> to add, use few autos from your <Skill id="5516"/> and <Skill id="5697"/> through the echo back to boss.
- If you have troubles with that part you can use 1-2 ticks from <Skill id="40183"/> to give deal some additional <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on add.
- Precast <Skill id="5531"/> on Siax.

### **3rd Phase**
- <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/>
 -> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/> -> auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> -> <Skill id="5557"/> -> Attune back to <Skill id="5494"/> for additional dmg from <Trait id="222"/>
- If timers are slow you will be able to skip auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> for <Skill id="5557"/> instantly.

- Attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5495"/>, attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> just before p2/p3 to get <Trait id="2131"/> buff.

- **NOTE:** Do not hesitate to use <Skill id="40709"/>, <Skill id="46447"/>, <Skill id="44405"/> if things are going hot. Just keep in mind that you have to be on <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> just as phase starts.

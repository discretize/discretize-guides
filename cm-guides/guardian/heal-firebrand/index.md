-   There are many setups that work on this boss. This variant helps a lot with CC which makes the fight a lot easier. However if your group struggles with this setup, consider swapping to a more healing-focused setup.

- When <Instability name="Afflicted"/> is present or if your group struggles with conditions, run <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> instead of <Skill name="Hammer of Wisdom"/>.

- When coming up with a setup for a condition-based group, keep in mind that <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> still provides excellent breakbar damage and Radiance still allows you to share <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> through <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/>. However it is less impactful to swap out <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> than in a power-based group.

</Boss>

### **General**

- This fight can be very different based on group DPS and CC.

- <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> skill 3 can be used to reflect the red orbs. The green ones will still put down the poison. This will be mainly useful for the split phases, however it can also be useful to watch out for the animation in the center since the orbs can one-shot anyone standing still right next to the boss.

- Your <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> will reset whenever you kill a Knight with the Radiance trait line. Use it for skill 4 to blast <Boon name="Might"/> or for skill 3 to provide additional CC. Skill 3 can also help by interrupting the small adds from inflicting <Condition name="Confusion"/>.

### **Prestacking**

- You can do the regular prestacking from the build guide including <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>.

1.  Place a Fire Field with <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4 or <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> if needed and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.

2.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and as many charges as possible of any other equipped Mantra.

3.  <Skill name="banesignet"/>

4.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_

5.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> once during the cast.

6.  Place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> while running to the boss and swap to Axe.

### **100%-75%**

- Stay on Axe until you casted a 2nd <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>.

1.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="Fury"/> when you reach the boss.

2.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to CC

3.  Use <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> to finish off the CC if needed. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3 can help too afterwards. Try to to save <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> for the red orbs (most likely on the way to the first Knight).

### **75%**

- Cast <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> while running to the Knight if the red orb attack is happening.

- Stand on the far side from the boss to avoid damage and bait the poison to spawn there. If your group is slow on killing the Knight, after the first poison spawns, go closer to the boss to stop the orbs and trigger the wind-up attack from the boss.

- If needed, you can use your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> for the reflect, <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

1.  Use <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/> to help with CC.

2.  Share a stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> through <Skill name="Mantra of liberation"/> if instant CC fails.

3.  If you still have <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> use its skill 3 to help with additioonal CC if needed as it will be reset after killing the Knight when running Radiance.

### **75%-50%**

- If any attack, especially the expanding circles, overlaps with the wind-up/knockback attack, make sure to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> at the last second. Otherwise provide <Boon name="Stability"/> and get ready to condi cleanse anyone who did not dodge the attack. Keep in mind that this attack will still one-shot people with bad instabilities so try to focus on learning to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> at the correct time.

- If the group DPS is high, do not break the defiance bar before 50%, otherwise try to break it as fast as possible. This is because you want to have the bar up after 50% to break it and get the boss to 25% with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> debuff.

1.  Use <Skill name="shieldofjudgment"/> to provide <Boon name="Protection"/> for MAMA's melee attacks if you are still on Axe/Shield and then swap to Staff.

2.  Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to renew <Boon name="Might"/>.

3.  Blast <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> if condi cleanse is needed (or use <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> if equipped). Try to only use your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> if it will be up for the last phase or if it is absolutely needed.

### **50%**

- Stand on the far side from the boss to avoid damage and bait the poison to spawn there. If your group is slow on killing the Knight, after the first poison spawns, go closer to the boss to stop the orbs and trigger the wind-up attack from the boss.

- If needed, you can use your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> for the reflect, <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>. Using it while running to the 2nd Knight is probably one of the best uses for <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> during this fight. However it is also very useful in the last phase.

1.  Use <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/> to help with CC.

2.  Share a stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> through <Skill name="Mantra of liberation"/> if instant CC fails.

3.  If you still have <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> use its skill 3 to help with additioonal CC if needed as it will be reset after killing the Knight when running Radiance.

### **50%-25%**

- Rotation in this phase will depend a lot on the group DPS and CC as well as what ewapon set you started on. Remember the basics of keeping up boons from the build guide.

1.  Assist on the breakbar with <Skill name="banesignet"/>, <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and, if needed, <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3.

2.  Use <Skill name="Tome of resolve"/> if needed when the big poison spawns. This might help your group to stay a little longer to get the boss to 25% or heal them up while moving to the 3rd Knight. Dropping some symbols before entering the Tome or using other healing skills if equipped will also help out here.

### **25%**

- Make sure you have enough CC up for this add so you don't have to deal with melee MAMA and the Knight at the same time for too long.

- Prepare for the jump attack. Depending on your group DPS and CC it will happen while the Knight is up or after it dies. Make sure to give at least one stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> and preferably also some <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the jump. <Boon name="Protection"/> helps out a lot too so either use <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/> or <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> if you have it up.

1.  Use <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/> to help with CC.

2.  Share a stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> through <Skill name="Mantra of liberation"/> if instant CC fails.

3.  If you still have <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> use its skill 3 to help with additioonal CC if needed as it will be reset after killing the Knight when running Radiance.

### **25%-0%**

1.  Help CC with whatever you have left.

2.  If you are using your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> in this phase, remember to also drop a skill 4 to negate the <Condition name="Blinded"/>.

3.  During the bosses' double arm swing, give one stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> if you still have something left in case people do not jump the shockwave.

4.  For the repeated arm swings, you can use your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> if you still have it and/or make sure to double dodge the attacks to both avoid damage and heal allies.

5.  If another jump or poison is happening, try to handle it as before. Give <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the jump and make sure to fully heal people up when the poison spawns.

<Boss name="siax" video="" videoCreator="" foodId="68634" utilityId="67528" healId="41714" utility1Id="40915" utility2="Bane Signet" utility3="Advance" elite="Mantra of Liberation" weapon1MainAffix="Berserker" weapon1MainType="staff" weapon1MainSigil1="transference" weapon1MainSigil2="concentration" weapon1MainInfusion1Id="37125" weapon1MainInfusion2Id="37125" weapon2OffAffix="Berserker" weapon2OffType="shield" weapon2OffSigil="transference" weapon2OffInfusionId="37125" weapon2MainAffix="Berserker" weapon2MainType="axe" weapon2MainSigil1="concentration" weapon2MainInfusion1Id="37125">
-   Once you get more familiar with sharing <Boon name="Aegis"/> at the correct times, you can also swap out <Skill name="Advance"/>. However taking <Skill name="Advance"/> will allow you to save it for using it on the Hallucination AoE every time.

- The <Boon name="Stability"/> from <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> is less useful here compared to other fights, however the <Boon name="Resolution"/> can be very strong. If you are unable to upkeep <Boon name="Fury"/>, swap to <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/>. Providing <Boon name="Quickness"/> should not be an issue even without it.

- <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/> and <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/> make this fight a lot more chaotic.

- When coming up with a setup for a condition-based group, keep in mind that <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> still provides excellent breakbar damage and Radiance still allows you to share <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> through <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/>. However it is less impactful to swap out <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> than in a power-based group. <Skill name="Hammer of Wisdom"/> and <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> can be good alternatives for CC. Virtues can help out with reducing the cooldown of <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> if you are running it.

</Boss>

### **Preparation**

- If your group struggles with the poison, one person might have to kite it. If this is you, then you will have to move away after the sharing <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the Hallucination AoE and dodge back to the group when the poison gets thrown to you. If the boss gets a breakbar, make sure to go back to the group instantly and help them break the bar.

- Most groups will mark sides to go to at 66%/33%. You will most likely go south with the <Specialization name="Renegade" text="Alacrity Renegade"/>. However if another person is struggling more, feel free to look around and help them out.

### **Prestacking**

- You can do the regular prestacking from the build guide (including <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> if your group is using a portal to get to the boss faster).

1.  Place a Fire Field with <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4 or <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> if needed and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.

2.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and as many charges as possible of any other equipped Mantra.

3.  <Skill name="banesignet"/>

4.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_

5.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> once during the cast.

6.  Place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> while running to the boss and swap to Axe.

### **100%-66%**

- If DPS is low be ready to use <Skill name="Advance"/> to <Boon name="aegis"/> the Hallucination's AoE

- If the Volatile Hallucinations are coming in before your group reaches 66%, try to position yourself opposite of where your Hallucination spawns so it gets cleaved on the way to you. You can also help out with the other Hallucinations by using <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3 to CC them when they get close.

1.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

2.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to CC.

3.  Use <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and <Skill name="Shield of absorption"/> as well as <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3 if needed to finish off the breakbar.

4.  If the phase continues longer, make sure to stay on Axe long enough to use another <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> so you don't drop <Boon name="Fury"/>.

### **66%**

1.  Position yourself with the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> using Axe to help with DPS!

2.  Be ready to swap to Staff early or even use <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> if a DPS desperatly needs healing. On Staff you can throw <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> on someone for a bit of healing from range.

### **66%-33%**

- Breakbar timings will heavily depend on your group DPS. In a fast group, you will not encounter a beakbar in this phase, in lower DPS groups you might encounter it towards the end or even in the middle of this phase.

1.  If you are still on Axe, you can drop a <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> on the boss while running back to it. If you do this, make sure to already start casting it before you fully reach the boss (since the symbol has a quite large radius) so you can swap to Staff to give <Boon name="Might"/> as fast as possible.

2.  Use <Skill name="Empower"/>, preferably while the boss is still <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

3.  Get ready to share <Boon name="aegis"/> for the Hallucination AoE.

4.  This is often a good time to use <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> skill 4 and 5 then use up all charges with skill 1. This will help with <Boon name="aegis"/> for the Hallucination AoE, grant <Boon name="stability"/> for the swipe attack, give <Boon name="protection"/> for the Volatile Hallucinations and grant <Boon name="Resistance"/> against <Condition name="Blinded"/>.

5.  Same as before, you also use <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3 to <Control name="Pull"/> some of the Volatile Hallucinations to avoid them from exploding at the same time. If needed, you can also enter your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> for the burst healing and condi cleanse.

6.  Try to swap back to Axe as soon as you can so you can once again help out your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> in the split phase.

### **33%**

1.  Position yourself with the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> using Axe to help with DPS!

2.  Be ready to swap to Staff early or even use <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> if a DPS desperatly needs healing. On Staff you can throw <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> on someone for a bit of healing from range.

### **33%-0%**

- Breakbar timings will heavily depend on your group DPS. In a fast group, you will not encounter a beakbar in the 2nd phase which will lead to a breakbar at the start of this phase. If there was a breakbar at the end of the 2nd phase, there will most likely be a breakbar towards the end of this phase as well. In that case, consider sharing <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> earlier for the group DPS buff.

- If there will be no early breakbar, handle this phase exactly the same as the 2nd phase. If there will be an early breakbar, do this instead:

1.  Cast <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>.

2.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to CC and finish off the breakbar with <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/>.

3.  Swap to Staff and use <Skill name="Empower"/>, preferably while the boss is still <Effect name="Exposed"/> or before while your group finishes off the breakbar.

4.  If the phase continues longer, then go back to handling the attacks as above.

<Boss name="ensolyss" video="" videoCreator="" foodId="68634" utilityId="67528" healId="41714" utility1Id="40915" utility2="Bane Signet" utility3="Mantra of Lore" elite="Mantra of Liberation" weapon1MainAffix="Berserker" weapon1MainType="staff" weapon1MainSigil1="transference" weapon1MainSigil2="concentration" weapon1MainInfusion1Id="37125" weapon1MainInfusion2Id="37125" weapon2OffAffix="Berserker" weapon2OffType="shield" weapon2OffSigil="transference" weapon2OffInfusionId="37125" weapon2MainAffix="Berserker" weapon2MainType="axe" weapon2MainSigil1="concentration" weapon2MainInfusion1Id="37125">
-   <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> is a great CC skill on Ensolyss as <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>.

- <Skill name="Advance"/> and <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> can help out if you struggle giving <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> for the important attacks.

- If you need the extra utility slot or extra CC on Sanctuary, consider running the Virtues variant.

- Be careful with <Skill name="Empower"/> since a lot of Ensolyss' attacks can interrupt it. Keep in mind you can give yourself <Boon name="Aegis"/> and/or <Boon name="Stability"/> against most attacks while channeling.

- In condition-based groups you can decide whether you want to run Radiance for sharing <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> or running Virtues for the extra CC on <Skill name="Sanctuary"/>. In both cases running <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> can be beneficial for CC.

</Boss>

### **General**

- Ensolyss has many attacks that can be negated with <Boon name="Aegis"/> and/or <Boon name="Stability"/>. This means you can help out your group a lot, especially classes that lock themselves into long animations like <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/>.

- Getting used to his attack pattern will help a lot with giving <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> at the correct times.

- Try to have <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> up for the slam attack. Everyone will still need to dodge the follow-up slam by the spawning adds.

- The tail swipe (cone in front of the boss) can be negated with <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Boon name="Stability"/> so players in it won't get knocked back into the orange explosion AoE since that is the main damaging part of this attack.

- The full AoE pull attack (that can cover the entire arena if he is in the center) can be easily dealt with with <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Boon name="Stability"/> as well.

- His knockback attack (2 attacks covering a quarter of the arena each) is hard to react to but can also be negated with <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Boon name="Stability"/>. For this attack it is best to know and put the boons on before it happens.

- His auto-attacks inflict <Condition name="Bleeding"/>. You can counteract this with <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> which will also grant <Boon name="Regeneration"/>. Your symbols, dodges and <Boon name="Regeneration"/> should be enough to keep people alive through his auto-attacks on top of providing healing for other attacks as well.

### **Preparation**

- It is possible to insta-CC Ensolyss before the dome spawns. Ask your group if you want to attempt this or not. This requires good timing and knowledge of CC skills on all 5 players.

### **Prestacking**

- You can do the regular prestacking from the build guide.

1.  Place a Fire Field with <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4 or <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> if needed and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.

2.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and as many charges as possible of any other equipped Mantra.

3.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_.

4.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> once during the cast.

5.  Place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> while running to the boss and swap to Axe.

### **100%-66%**

- Focus on giving <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> for the slam and tail swipe attack in this phase.

- Make sure to stay on Axe long enough to use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> 2 times.

1.  Place <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> while the boss still has <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> to start providing <Boon name="Fury"/>.

2.  This part will depend on whether your group decided to go for the instant CC or not.

    1.  If your group decided to insta-CC, use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with the breakbar.

    2.  Otherwise either use <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> for a head-start on the breakbar or skip this step entirely if you don't feel confident timing these skills well. The reason for delaying <Skill name="BAne Signet"/> without insta-CC is that you want to share its passive for <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

3.  After the dome, use anything you have on the breakbar if you did not insta-break it.

4.  Get ready to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> for the slam attack if your group does not break the bar fast enough.

5.  After this, handle the mechanics as described above in the General section. Make sure to not use <Skill name="Empower"/> when he is teleporting away as this attack will interrupt you unless you have multiple stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/>.

### **66%**

- Swap to Staff in this phase so you are able to give boons as soon as the phase is over.

- Handle this phase the same as you would on any other class. Remember to prioritize staying alive over anything else. If someone dies and you have to cover an extra circle, make sure to not stack up with multiple players as you will end up sharing blue orbs but getting hit by the same red orbs.

- Since everyone in the red circles receives <Effect name="Agony"/>, do not bother too much with healing until the phase is over.

- If you are running with a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, keep an eye out if they have an active <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> or <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/>. If this is the case, try to throw a <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> on it so it stays alive.

### **66%-33%**

- In this phase there will be 2 additional mechanics that you have to pay attention to, the arena-wide pull attack and the knockback.

1.  Once everyone is back in the center, stack boons again. Open your <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> and use skill 4, blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and use <Skill name="Empower"/>. Use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> if you still have it up and swap to Axe for <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>.

2.  If you have <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> equipped, use it first on the breakbar.

3.  Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and, if needed, <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> for CC. Give <Boon name="Aegis"/> to your group to reduce damage taken and heal them up. If your symbols and dodges are not enough, use your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/>.

4.  After going to the dome, make sure that everyone has <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the pull attack. Then re-new <Boon name="Aegis"/> and give a stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> for the slam attack. This can be a good time to use <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> since you will want <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> for the next attacks as well.

5.  If you did not use your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/>, go through another charge of your <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> for the knockback attack.

6.  If the phase continues longer, handle the mechanics the same as before.

### **33%**

- Handle this exactly the same as before. Make sure to swap to Staff, keep an eye out for friendly Spirits and focus on staying alive.

### **33%-0%**

- Depending on group DPS, there might be one new attack in this phase where Ensolyss tries to pull people towards him with a Shockwave and deals massive damage around him.

- Other than that, make sure you have a lot of <Boon name="Stability"/> or <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the 15% phase, preferably through <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/>

1.  Once everyone is back in the center, stack boons again. Open your <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> and use skill 4, blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and use <Skill name="Empower"/>. Use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> if you still have it up and swap to Axe for <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>.

2.  If you have <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> equipped, use it first on the breakbar.

3.  Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and, if needed, <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> for CC. Give <Boon name="Aegis"/> to your group to reduce damage taken and heal them up. If your symbols and dodges are not enough, use your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/>.

4.  After going to the dome, make sure that everyone has some <Boon name="Stability"/> for the shockwave. If needed, go into your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> to heal everyone up who got hit.

5.  Handle the rest of the mechanics same as before until your group reaches 15%.

6.  At 15% open your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and use skill 5 and 1. Combined with <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/>, this will be more than enough <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> for this phase.

<Boss name="skorvald" video="" videoCreator="" foodId="68634" utilityId="67528" healId="41714" utility1Id="40915" utility2="Bane Signet" utility3="STand Your Ground" elite="Mantra of Liberation" weapon1MainAffix="Berserker" weapon1MainType="staff" weapon1MainSigil1="transference" weapon1MainSigil2="concentration" weapon1MainInfusion1Id="37125" weapon1MainInfusion2Id="37125" weapon2OffAffix="Berserker" weapon2OffType="shield" weapon2OffSigil="transference" weapon2OffInfusionId="37125" weapon2MainAffix="Berserker" weapon2MainType="axe" weapon2MainSigil1="concentration" weapon2MainInfusion1Id="37125">
-   This encounter is fairly straight forward for a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>. You can mainly focus on helping with breakbars and sharing <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> at key moments.

- There is usually no need to swap to any other utility, however <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> is another strong choice for <Boon name="Stability"/> after 33%.

- <Skill name="Wall of Reflection"/> can be used to counteract <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> and <Skill name="MAntra of Lore"/> can help with condi cleanse.

</Boss>

### **Preparation**

- Ask the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> if they are bringing <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> or not so you know if you have to solo-provide <Boon name="Stability"/> on the islands.

- Make sure to know if your group has <Item name="White Mantle Portal Device"/> for 66% and 33%. If you only have 1 in the group, prioritize 33%.

### **Prestacking**

- You can do the regular prestacking from the build guide including <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>.

1.  Place a Fire Field with <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4 or <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> if needed and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.

2.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and as many charges as possible of any other equipped Mantra.

3.  Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>.

4.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_.

5.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> once during the cast.

6.  Place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> while running to the boss and swap to Axe.

### **100%-66%**

1.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="Fury"/> before the boss spawns.

2.  Use <Skill name="bane signet"/> to CC

3.  Finish off the breakbar with <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/>.

4.  Stay on Axe until the phase ends or until you used a 2nd <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>.

### **66%**

- If your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is running <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>, use your <Boon name="Stability"/> whenever you notice that there is no <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/> placed.

- This following rotation assumes you are soloing <Boon name="Stability"/>.

1.  First Island

    1.  Share <Boon name="Aegis"/> using <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>.

    2.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

    3.  Swap to Staff if you can, otherwise do it on the third island.

2.  Second Island

    1.  Enter <Skill name="tome of courage"/> and use Skill 5 and 1 for <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>. Try to use the last 2 charges shortly before leaving the island.

3.  Third Island

    1.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the first attack.

    2.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> to share <Boon name="Stability"/> for the second attack and to potentially stun-break any allies arriving late.

    3.  Use <Skill name="tome of justice"/> skill 4 and blast it with <Skill name="holystrike"/>. This can be done during the above steps.

4.  Fourth island

    1.  Use <Skill name="Stand your ground"/> and <Skill name="empower"/> instantly upon landing. This will ensure that you will not get interrupted during the cast.

    2.  Use <Skill name="bane signet"/> and take the portal. (If your group does not use a portal here, just skip this step and use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> after the boss finished dashing around.)

### **66%-33%**

1.  Swap to Axe and use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

2.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> to share <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Resolution"/> when everyone gets the red AoE around them and get ready to cleanse anyone who got hit by the attack. Try to dodge the attack towards the boss yourself so you don't get hit and heal allies at the same time.

3.  Keep up your boon rotation until the phase ends.

### **33%**

- If your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is running <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>, use your <Boon name="Stability"/> whenever you notice that there is no <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/> placed.

- You want to safe <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> for the last phase unless your group has really high DPS and can kill the boss before it does any attacks.

1.  First Island

    1.  Share <Boon name="Aegis"/> using <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>.

    2.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

2.  Second Island

    1.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> and then jump the first attack.

    2.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/>. If you are still on the Axe set, you can also use <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/> to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> to save a charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>. Afterwards swap to Staff.

3.  Third Island

    1.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the first attack.

    2.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> to share <Boon name="Stability"/> for the second attack and to potentially stun-break any allies arriving late.

    3.  Use <Skill name="tome of justice"/> skill 4 and blast it with <Skill name="holystrike"/>. This can be done during the above steps.

4.  Fourth island

    1.  Use <Skill name="Stand your ground"/> and <Skill name="empower"/> instantly upon landing. This will ensure that you will not get interrupted during the cast.

    2.  Use <Skill name="bane signet"/> and take the portal. (If your group does not use a portal here, just skip this step and use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> on the main platform.)

- If your group DPS is very low and you also need to have <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> ready for the last phase, make the following changes:

1.  Second Island

    1.  Use <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> as it will be up again for the last phase.

2.  Fourth Island

    1.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> and then jump the first attack.

    2.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> again while casting <Skill name="Empower"/>.

### **33%-0%**

1.  Swap to Axe.

2.  If a breakbar is available use as many CC skills as quickly as possible in an attempt to break the defiance bar in the short time frame provided! However the breakbar will rarely have regenerated in time.

3.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

4.  Once the <Effect name="Exposed"/> is about to end, enter your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> to share <Boon name="Stability"/>.

5.  Make sure to keep at least one charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the bloom explosion. This needs to be timed very well.

6.  After leaving your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/>, go into your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> to cleanse and heal your group. If you have time, you can drop symbols and use other skills to give boons if they are up before entering this Tome.

7.  Once the <Boon name="Stability"/> from your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> is about to run out, use <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> if you saved it for this phase.

8.  If the phase continues longer than this, try to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> for blooms and <Boon name="Stability"/> whenever you can. Remember that dodging also heals your group so you should never run out of healing.

-   This can be a very high pressure fight. As a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> in this fight you need to provide sufficient <Boon name="aegis"/> and <Boon name="stability"/> for various attacks to ensure your DPS players are not being interupted as well as providing enough healing and condi cleanse.

- **Important:** The reflect on Artsariiv scales with the player's <Attribute name="Precision"/>! If you have another class that can provide a reflect, let them reflect as they will be doing much more damage with it. If nobody else can provide a reflect, it might be worth taking it yourself as a defense against the boss' attacks.

- If your group is struggling a lot, consider running Virtues on this fight, especially when you are using <Skill name="Wall of Reflection"/> (if nobody else can provide a reflect) since there is a lot of good utility skills that you can take on this fight. This should usually not be necessary as the above setup in combination with the rest of your kit will provide you with everything you need for keeping your group alive. You will also lose a lot of CC and the group DPS buff that can help meet important DPS checks in this fight.

- If you ever get CC'ed, remember that <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> is a stun-break.

</Boss>

### **General**

- There are a lot of different attacks going on in this fight. Your main focus will be to have <Boon name="Stability"/> up during important burn phases and give <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the slam attack (indicated by an orange AoE around the boss) while providing enough healing and condi cleanse against other random attacks.

### **Preparation**

- Ask the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> if they are bringing <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> or not.

### **Prestacking**

- You can do the regular prestacking from the build guide.

1.  Place a Fire Field with <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4 or <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> if needed and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.

2.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and as many charges as possible of any other equipped Mantra.

3.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_.

4.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> once during the cast.

5.  Place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> while running to the boss and swap to Axe.

### **100%-66%**

- In case you are reflecting, it is not to do damage, but to negate incoming attacks. This means if your group is breaking the boss decently fast, you should save your reflects until after the <Effect name="Exposed"/> has ended. Keep in mind that you will only need to do this if there is no other class with a reflect in your group.

1.  Precast <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

2.  Use <Skill name="standyourground"/> so players don't get <Condition name="Fear"/> by the boss or <Control name="Knockdown"/> by the adds. Skip this step if your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is prvoding <Skill name="Inspiring reinforcement"/> and use <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> in he corner instead.

3.  Use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to the corner after the anomaly is dead.

4.  Open your <Skill name="tome of courage"/> and use skill 5, 4 and 1 to ensure your DPS players are not interrupted, especially if they are reflecting. You can save this Tome if you still have <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> and use it at this point instead.

5.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to CC. When finishing the bar off with other skills be careful to not use <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> as it can negate the projectiles.

6.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> to <Boon name="aegis"/> Artsariiv's attacks, especially the 5th attack in her attack chain (the orange Aoe around her).

7.  Use <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> to heal up the party if needed.

8.  <Skill name="Mantraofliberation"/> can provide some extra safety as a backup after the initial <Boon name="Stability"/> wears off and the <Boon name="Resolution"/> helps with the incoming conditions.

### **66%**

- There is nothing special in this phase. Use your CC skills and make sure to have weapon swap up when the phase ends. If you can choose, try to be on Axe when the phase ends. This is where your CC is anyways so it should not be an issue.

### **66%-33%**

Middle:

1.  Provide boons with <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> and <Skill name="Empower"/>.

2.  Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> And <Skill name="mantraofliberation"/> to ensure the players don't get <Control name="knockdown"/> or take lethal damage from the one-shot attack.

3.  At this point you can use <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/> skill 4 and blast it with <Skill name="holystrike"/>. This will also help a bit

4.  Use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to the corner (after the anomaly is dead).

Corner:

1.  Use <Skill name="standyourground"/> to ensure your DPS players are not interrupted, especially if they are reflecting.

2.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/> regardless of CC to share the 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> for this burn phase.

3.  After this, handle the rest of the phase the same as before.

4.  Depending on group DPS you might encounter a breakbar, use whatever you have if this is the case unless the boss is a few % away from phasing anyways.

### **33%**

- There is nothing special in this phase. Use your CC skills and make sure to have weapon swap up when the phase ends. If you can choose, try to be on Axe when the phase ends. This is where your CC is anyways so it should not be an issue.

- Try to prioritise the side adds over the corner adds and make sure to <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to any white AoE you see.

### **33%-0%**

- Handle this phase exactly the same as 66%-33%.

-   Your 3rd utility slot in this fight is rather open. You can take whatever you need most, <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> for extra <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/> for the extra healing or even <Skill name="Merciful Intervention"/> if your group downs a lot.

- <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> is still great against <Instability name="Afflicted"/> and <Skill name="Wall of Reflection"/> can help with <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> and to a lesser degree with the red orb attack.

- In a condition-based group, you can easily swap out <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> for <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/> since neither has to be timed with breakbars in this fight.

</Boss>

### **General**

- Share <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> in DPS phases independant of breakbars.

- Try to use <Boon name="Stability"/> when Arkk has the eye above his head to prevent your group from getting <Condition name="Fear"/>.

- Try to share <Boon name="Aegis"/> and/or <Boon name="Stability"/> for his <Control name="Float"/> attack after 60%.

- Other than that, just try to handle the mechanics yoruself as best as you can and time your heals based on which mechanics the group struggles with.

- <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> is a blast finisher. Therefore you can use a <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4 to create a fire field before everyone is using their Special Action Key. This would be when he has the red orb above his head and after the bloom phase when he gets a breakbar.

### **Preparation**

- If your group marks sides for the bloom phases, you should take one too so the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> can stay in the center to prepare for the breakbar.

### **Prestacking**

- You can do the regular prestacking from the build guide including <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>.

1.  Place a Fire Field with <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4 or <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> if needed and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.

2.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and as many charges as possible of any other equipped Mantra.

3.  Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>.

4.  Use <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> if equipped.

5.  Take _Mistlock Singularity_.

6.  <Skill name="Empower"/> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> once during the cast.

7.  Place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> while running to the boss and swap to Axe.

### **100%-80%**

1.  Use <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

2.  Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to share its passive again.

3.  Stay on Axe until the boss phases or until you used a 2nd <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> for <Boon name="Fury"/>.

4.  Try to handle the mechanics as desribed in the general section and make sure to swap to Staff when you reach 80%.

### **80%**

1.  Go to your side, push the bloom clockwise into the tower and head back to the center.

2.  Use <Skill name="Tome Of Justice"/> skill 4 in the center once the last bloom is getting pushed in so other people can blast <Boon name="Might"/> with their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/>. If you notice people not using their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> for CC here, you can use the Tome while the add is up instead.

### **80%-70%**

1.  Use <Skill name="Empower"/> for <Boon name="Might"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/>.

2.  Weapon Swap.

3.  Use <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

### **70%: Archdiviner**

- Make sure to avoid the red AoEs as they will corrupt your boons. Once the breakbar appears, try to CC the add with your <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> which will also blast <Boon name="Might"/> if you casted a fire field through <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4.

1.  Try to pull in one add with <Skill name="blazingedge"/>.

2.  Give <Boon name="Stability"/> with <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> if equipped or <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> otherwise.

3.  If you still have it up, use <Skill name="tome of justice"/> and <Control name="pull"/> with skill 3 the mobs closer to the middle, then use chapter 4 (make sure you enter and exit the tome **before** the split phase add dies so it gets reset)

4.  Use <Skill name="holystrike"/> to blast <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/>'s fire field.

5.  Cast <Skill name="banesignet"/> as the add is about to die.

### **70%-50%**

- Remember that the <Control name="Float"/> attack will start to happen after 60%. Even though it can be jumped over, try to give <Boon name="Stability"/> if possible since the jump animation is very long with the low gravity.

1.  Precast <Skill name="empower"/> for <Boon name="Might"/>.

2.  Either use <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/> skill 4 and blast it again with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> or wait until the red orb attack happens so everyone blasts it with their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/>.

3.  Weapon swap.

4.  Use <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

5.  This is a great time to use <Skill name="tomeofcourage"/> skills 5,4,3 and spam 1. This provides <Boon name="stability"/> for <Condition name="Fear"/>, <Boon name="aegis"/> for melee attacks and a reflect for the agony circles. It will also help the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> not getting caught off guard by an agony AoE, with his back to the boss while killing the anomaly. It will also most likely be up again for the last phase if you use it here.

6.  Use <Skill name="shieldofjudgment"/> for <Boon name="aegis"/> and extra <Boon name="Protection"/> before swapping back to Staff.

### **50%**

1.  Go to your side, push the bloom clockwise into the tower and head back to the center.

2.  Use <Skill name="Tome Of Justice"/> skill 4 in the center once the last bloom is getting pushed in so other people can blast <Boon name="Might"/> with their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/>. If you notice people not using their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> for CC here, you can use the Tome while the add is up instead.

### **50%-40%**

1.  Use <Skill name="Empower"/> for <Boon name="Might"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/>.

2.  Weapon Swap.

3.  Use <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

### **40%: Gladiator**

- Once the breakbar appears, try to CC the add with your <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> which will also blast <Boon name="Might"/> if you casted a fire field through <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 4.

1.  Try to pull in one add with <Skill name="blazingedge"/>.

2.  Give <Boon name="Stability"/> with <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> if equipped or <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> otherwise.

3.  If you still have it up, use <Skill name="tome of justice"/> and <Control name="pull"/> with skill 3 the mobs closer to the middle, then use skill 4. Make sure you enter and exit the tome **before** the split phase add dies so it gets reset.

4.  Use <Skill name="holystrike"/> to blast <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/>'s fire field.

5.  Cast <Skill name="banesignet"/> as the add is about to die.

### **40%-30%**

1.  Precast <Skill name="empower"/> for <Boon name="Might"/>.

2.  Either use <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/> skill 4 and blast it again with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> or wait until the red orb attack happens so everyone blasts it with their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/>.

3.  Weapon swap.

4.  Use <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

5.  This is most likely the moment where <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> will be required to ensure your group gets to 30% safely.

### **30%**

- In this bloom phase you will probably be on Axe so you will have to push like you would on any other class. The safest option is to wait until the bloom tethers to you, head to the corner and let it follow you, then get behind it and hit it once in to the tower with an auto-attack.

1.  Go to your side, push the bloom clockwise into the tower and head back to the center.

2.  Use <Skill name="Tome Of Justice"/> skill 4 in the center once the last bloom is getting pushed in so other people can blast <Boon name="Might"/> with their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/>. If you notice people not using their <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> for CC here, you can use the Tome when the red orb appears in the last phase instead.

### **30%-0%**

1.  Use <Skill name="symbol of vengeance"/> for <Boon name="fury"/>.

2.  Weapon Swap.

3.  Use <Skill name="empower"/> to refresh <Boon name="Might"/>.

4.  This is a perfect time to use <Skill name="tomeofcourage"/> again with skill 5,4,3 and spam 1. This provides <Boon name="stability"/> for <Condition name="Fear"/>, <Boon name="aegis"/> for melee attacks and a reflect for the agony AoEs.

5.  If the phase continues for longer, it can get very chaotic. Try to use up whatever you have left to get thrugh the rest of the phase.

-   When <Instability name="Afflicted"/> is present, run <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> instead of <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/>. You will still be able to share <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> through <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/>. You can also take this skill if people struggle with attacks that inflict conditions during the fire phase.

- Other good utility skills are <Skill name="Advance"/> for extra <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/> for extra healing.

- When more healing or the extra CC on <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> from <Trait name="Master of Consecrations"/> is needed, consider swapping to the Virtues variant.

- If you do not need the <Boon name="Resolution"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> from <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> feel free to swap to another elite skill.

- If your group has multiple <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Firebrand"/> keeping up <Boon name="Fury"/>, you can swap to Mace for extra healing and <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

</Boss>

### **General**

- This guide is meant to give an idea for keeping up boons on the actual boss fight.

- The general rules from the build guide still apply.

- Use <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> down to 2 charges and <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> down to 0 charges whenever stacked. Share <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/> whenever you can. This applies to the skill as well as the <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/> version.

- You will need to time your heals differently based on which attacks your group gets hit by.

### **Preparation**

- Make sure to communicate with your group whether you will break the boss at the edge or in the center.

- Since most PuGs break the boss in the center, this is what the guide will focus on. If your group breaks on the edge, keep in mind that the CC window is shorter so prioritise getting out all CC quickly there.

- Communicate who in your group has a <Item name="White Mantle Portal Device"/>. Prioritise using it at 66% if you only have 1 in the group.

### **Prestacking**

- Once the fight starts, all boons will be stripped. However you are still able to pre-stack unique buffs like sharing <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/> through <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.

### **100%-Cloud Phase**

1.  Start on Staff. Make sure to not trigger the boss with an auto-attack before everyone is in range.

2.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> in the center to give <Boon name="Swiftness"/> so everyone can chase Ai after the first dash faster.

3.  Once you are in combat, start giving boons immediately by using <Skill name="Empower"/> and cast <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> once and <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> as often as you can. This will provide instant <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/>.

4.  While running towards the edge to the boss, use <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/> open your <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> and use skill 4 on the boss to trigger <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and swap to Axe.

5.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> to provide <Boon name="Fury"/> and use <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/> for <Boon name="Protection"/>.

6.  You will be able to use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> a second time before Ai dashes back to the center.

7.  When Ai dashes back to the center, swap to Staff and start spreading out early. This way you will be ready to give <Boon name="Might"/> once everyone is stacked back together.

8.  If your group repeatedly struggles with the arrow mechanic during the spread, consider entering your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> an placing the skill 3 in the center to counter the projectiles.

9.  After the spread attack is over, dodge towards the center through her attacks and give boons again with <Skill name="Empower"/>, <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>. This should also heal back anyone to full HP.

10. Place your <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> on the boss but save your other CC for later as you ideally want to finish breaking the bar during the 4th attack or once the red AoE appears.

11. Use <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/> on the 3rd attack (the full 360° AoE) to ensure your group has <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Protection"/> since this attack hits multiple times.

12. If the breakbar is still up after this, finish it off with <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/>, <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3.

13. If equipped, you can use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> to grant <Boon name="Stability"/> to your group in case they dodge the attacks away from the boss and into the outer attacks.

14. If you get the boss to 66% in the center, you will move on to the Meteor phase, otherwise the boss will dash to the outside and back to the center and you will see the cloud phase. Get out of the center quickly in this case.

### **Cloud Phase**

- This phase is rather easy and the time limit is not very strict so focus on not getting hit by your own or other people's AoEs.

- If someone gets hit in this phase, they will also have Agony, so try to heal them up after the phase ends.

### **Cloud Phase-66%**

- Keep your priority as above and handle her attacks the exact same way as before the cloud phase.

### **66% Meteor Phase**

1.  If you have a <Item name="White Mantle Portal Device"/>, place it in the center.

2.  Head towards the edge of the arena. Make sure to be on Staff and give <Boon name="Swiftness"/>.

3.  If you ever get separated, try to move towards the rest of your group between meteor explosions.

4.  During the 4th set of meteors 2 people will get targeted by meteors that will explode shortly after the 4th set.

5.  With Portal: Open your portal once you see the personal meteors but do not take it until the shockwaves of the 4th meteor set has passed the center.

6.  Without Portal: Wait until the 4th set of meteors exploded, then run towards the center and double-dodge across the shockwave to also dodge the explosion of the personal meteors at the same time.

7.  If your group struggles with this, give them some <Boon name="Stability"/> through <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> or <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/>.

8.  Get ready to condi cleanse your group in the center and stack boons again.

9.  If someone goes downstate, immediately go to rez them instead and give <Boon name="Aegis"/> while rezzing through <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> so you do not get interrupted by potential exploding rocks.

10. Hide behind the safe rock with your group and give <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Boon name="Stability"/> if your group struggles to dodge the explosion afterwards.

### **66% - 33%**

1.  Handle attacks the same way as in Phase 1. The same "rotation" can be applied, however most attacks in this phase apply <Condition name="Burning"/>.

2.  After the spread, phase the boss in the center to 33% or you have to deal with the 2nd meteor phase.

3.  2nd Meteor Phase: The personal meteors spawn during the first (and only) set of meteors in this phase and go off faster than at 66%. Pay attention to the orange AoE indicator on the meteors to know when to double-dodge to the center. After this, handle the phase the same as the 66% meteor phase.

4.  If you did not phase to 33%, handle the mechanics the same way as before.

### **33% Water Phase**

1.  Move towards the center with your group after you get pushed back but make sure everyone stays in the green circles.

2.  Outhealing the greens is rather easy and can be achieved by simply placing symbols and using <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>.

3.  If someone downs in this phase, make sure to take the tether from them first and then start reviving them.

4.  There will be 4 blooms spawning, starting north and going clockwise with the last one spawning west. Make sure to be on Staff to give <Boon name="Might"/> when the west bloom is active and the boss returns.

5.  If you have no stacks when the last bloom spawns in, wait until the person got a few stacks and then take it over so that nobody gets left behind building up too many stacks while moving to the boss.

### **33%-0%**

- The water tornadoes in this phase are significantly harder to avoid than the previous AoEs.

1.  After Ai dashes to the side, follow her but stay in the remaining green AoE.

2.  You can side-step the first 2 tornadoes while moving to the boss, you can avoid the 3rd one (from the left side) by standing in between the tornadoes. Once the 4th set (from the right side) reaches you, dodge into the wall to avoid the 4th and 5th set at the same time.

3.  If your group struggles with this, open your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> when the 3rd set is coming in and use skill 5 and 4. This will give your group some extra <Attribute name="Toughness"/> as well as <Boon name="Protection"/> and <Boon name="Resistance"/> to counter the <Condition name="Slow"/>.

4.  After the spread, finish her off in the center or you have to deal with the 2nd water phase.

5.  During the 2nd water phase there will be more blooms spawning as well as Ai being covered by a tornado that reflects projectiles so be careful and do not use your Staff auto-attack.

6.  If your group struggles with this phase, try to stay at the edge of the arena instead of staying close to the tornado in the center and move back once you see the boss coming back.

7.  After this handle the mechanics the same way as before until Ai is dead.

-   When <Instability name="Afflicted"/> is present, run <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> instead of <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/>. You will still be able to share <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> through <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/>.

- Other good utility skills are <Skill name="Advance"/> for extra <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/> for extra healing.

- When more healing or the extra CC on <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> from <Trait name="Master of Consecrations"/> is needed, consider swapping to the Virtues variant.

- If your group has multiple <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Firebrand"/> keeping up <Boon name="Fury"/>, you can swap to Mace for extra healing and <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

### **General**

- A lot of attacks work similar to Light Ai. However the elemental attacks are replaced by lasers. This means you can handle most mechanics the same way as before.

### **Preparation**

- Make sure to communicate with your group whether you will break the boss after the 1st or 2nd dash.

- Since most PuGs break the boss after the 2nd dash, this is what the guide will focus on. If your group breaks after 1st dash, keep in mind that the CC window is shorter so prioritise getting out all CC quickly there.

- Decide how to split at 33%. There will be 2 Sorrows spawning. When looking from the center towards the Guilt, one Sorrow will be left and one will be right of the Guilt. Most groups will have supports left and DPS right.

### **Prestacking**

- Once the fight starts, all boons will be stripped. However you are still able to pre-stack unique buffs like sharing <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/> through <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.

### **100%-66%**

1.  Start on Staff. Make sure to not trigger the boss with an auto-attack before everyone is in range.

2.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> in the center to give <Boon name="Swiftness"/> so everyone can chase Ai after the first dash faster. Cast <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> once and <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> as often as you can. This will provide instant <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/>.

3.  While running towards the edge to the boss, use <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/>, open your <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> and use skill 4 on the boss to trigger <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.

4.  Once you are at the edge, use <Skill name="Empower"/> and swap to Axe.

5.  Use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> to provide <Boon name="Fury"/> and use <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/> for <Boon name="Protection"/>.

6.  When Ai dashes a 2nd time, swap to Staff and start spreading out early. This way you will be ready to give <Boon name="Might"/> once everyone is stacked back together.

7.  If your group repeatedly struggles with the arrow mechanic during the spread, consider entering your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> an placing the skill 3 in the center to counter the projectiles.

8.  After the spread attack is over, dodge towards Ai through her attacks and give boons again with <Skill name="Empower"/>, <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>. This should also heal back anyone to full HP.

9.  Place your <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> on the boss but save your other CC for later as you ideally want to finish breaking the bar during the 4th attack or once the red AoE appears. You can skip <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> here if your group is able to break the bar without it, phases fast AND if you need to use it at 66% for the Sorrow.

10. Use <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/> on the 3rd attack (the full 360° AoE) to ensure your group has <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Protection"/> since this attack hits multiple times.

11. If the breakbar is still up after this, finish it off with <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/>, <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3.

12. If equipped, you can use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> to grant <Boon name="Stability"/> to your group in case they dodge the attacks away from the boss and into the outer attacks.

13. After this, Ai will dash to another side and do these 2 attacks again. However there will be no breakbar up this time so you will have to spread out unless you get to 66% before the spread attack starts. Handle this the same way as before.

14. If your group downs to the blue AoEs make sure to revive them fast but make sure to stand outside of them while reviving. As always make sure to give <Boon name="Aegis"/> while reviving.

### **66% Sorrow Phase**

- Whenever you reach 66%, Ai will dash to the center and start this phase.

- You will be able to outheal the constant damage happening in the center with your symbols.

1.  CC from range with <Skill name="Sanctuary"/>, <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> skill 3. If needed, use <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/>. However you will need to be closer with this.

2.  If someone steps too close to the Sorrow and downs make sure to pick them up fast and spam <Boon name="Aegis"/> while doing so.

3.  Once the Fears start spawning, open your <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and use skill 5 and 1 to grant <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Protection"/> to your group.

4.  If the boss moves to the edge again, follow her but be careful with the Fears. Make sure to not leave anyone behind. If someone gets stunned by a Fear you can break them out of the stun with <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/>.

5.  If the boss stays in the center, try to avoid the Fears and make sure to pay attention to whether someone gets hit so you can stun-break them with <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> and heal them up. If a lot of people stay close to the boss, there is a very high chance that at least one Fear will explode on the group.

6.  If you do not break the boss during this, you will have to spread out after the 5th attack. Try to heal people up before this after the Fears despawn if needed.

### **33% Guilt/Sorrow Phase**

- Whenever you reach 33%, Ai will dash to the center and start this phase.

- Make sure you go to the correct Sorrow but keep an eye out on the other one.

- Take the tether from the Guilt as the boss would otherwise gain a lot of incoming damage reduction and outgoing damage. Once you gain some stacks, give the tether to someone else or, if nobody is around, give it back to the boss.

- Otherwise handle this phase exactly like the 66% Sorrow phase.

### **66%-0%**

- Handle the attacks the same way as before. Make sure to not waste <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> unless you know it will be back up for the 33% Sorrow phase.

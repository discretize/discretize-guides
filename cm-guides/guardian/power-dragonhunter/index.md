This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. Especially at this fight it is recommended to grab extra CC skills to make up for the lack of CC of your team mates.
</Message>
</Boss>

### **Precast**

- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.

- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.

- You can use <Skill name="hallowed ground"/> for fire field and/or <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

### **Synopsis**

- Start on Scepter/Sword.

- Try to use your full burst (either you start the phase on GS or sword/scepter) in each phase after breakbar is broken.

- Don't forget that you can not expect to see the highest numbers without the breakbar being frequently broken: to make that happen use <Skill name="banesignet"/>. <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and <Specialization name="Berserker"/> will not break the bar alone so DO NOT be selfish.

- Do not use traps on the adds.

- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> inside MAMAs hitbox, when the small adds are coming close.

- Feel free to use <Skill name="symbol of blades"/>, <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> and <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/> for faster movement.

- You can take <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/> to help CC the adds.

-   Use your <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> inside Siax' hitbox to get 5 additional hits. This is the reason why <Specialization name="Guardian"/> is very strong at this boss. Do not miss this.

- Use one <Skill id="9168"/> at the start of every phase and save one <Skill id="9168"/> for every add.

- It is beneficial to take a sword here to quickly blink to the add.

- Use <Skill name="Wings of resolve"/> to navigate around and keep your HP up.

- Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and buff your party.

- Use <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> and <Skill name="Shieldofcourage"/> to block the expanding AoEs.

- Check with your team if you take <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>

</Boss>

### **Precast**

- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss and force your team to `/gg`.

- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.

- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss if you are using a portal.

### **100%-66%**

- Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull.

- If your team has very high DPS (phases Siax in >5s) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.

- No matter what group you are running with, start on scepter/sword!

- If you are running in a PuG or just clear it daily, it is beneficial to delay your traps slightly, to fit more of the hits into the cc bar.

- In a fast team save <Skill name="bindingblade"/> for the 2nd phase when the adds spawn, if not use it. Just make sure to press it when the adds are in range for big DPS.

- Use <Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill name="bindingblade"/> only if it's during second's phase expose up again.

### _1st Add_

- Use <Skill id="9168"/> for <Condition name="vulnerability"/> and damage.

- <Skill name="Whirling wrath"/> and a couple AA to kill it.

- Use <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/>, <Skill name="Symbol of blades"/> and <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> for movement.

### **66%-33%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

### _2nd Add_

- Use <Skill id="9168"/> for <Condition name="vulnerability"/> and damage..

- Kill it with a symbol and AAs.

- In fast runs you might wanna save a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.

### **33%-0%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

<Boss name="ensolyss" video="" videoCreator="" foodId="91805" utilityId="50082" heal="litanyofwrath" utility1="swordofjustice" utility2="processionofblades" utility3Id="9093" eliteId="29965" weapon1MainAffix="Berserker" weapon1MainType="Greatsword" weapon1MainSigil1="serpentslaying" weapon1MainSigil2="Impact" weapon1MainInfusion1Id="37131" weapon2OffAffix="Berserker" weapon2OffType="Focus" weapon2OffSigil="serpentslaying" weapon2OffInfusionId="37131" weapon2MainAffix="Berserker" weapon2MainType="Sword" weapon2MainSigil1="Impact" weapon2MainInfusion1Id="37131">
-   You can abuse <Skill name="bindingblade"/> here. After Ensolyss spawns the a circle under every party member there is a short period of time where these circles spawn an add which can be abused to get all hits with <Skill name="bindingblade"/>.

</Boss>

### **Synopsis**

- Breakbar should be broken at the start of the fight, use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to help to make it happen.

- Start on Scepter/Sword.

- Try to fit every single skill you have into <Effect name="Exposed"> (few seconds after the bar is broken), feel free to precast a symbol, and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before Ensolyss becomes vulnerable.</Effect>

- After you used your full opener, continue with your usual rotation until you phase.

- Repeat this every single phase.

-   Bring <Skill name="standyourground"/> if you have the feeling that your team can't cover <Boon name="Stability"/>.

- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss.

- In fast groups you want to play with <Trait name="heavylight"/> instead of <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>

</Boss>

### **Burn phases**

Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull. If your team has very high DPS (i.e. they phase Skorvald in less than 5 seconds) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.

### **Adds**

You can kill the first two adds with a greatsword. You can use traps on the 2nd add, without having them on cooldown when you are back at Skorvald. Make sure, that you are on scepter/sword at the last add and you are not having cooldown on the weapon swap, or you DPS will suffer a lot. You can freely use Traps and GS on the first two adds. Swap to scepter/sword after that.

-   If your team does not have a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, you can take <Skill name="Wall of reflection"/> for reflects. Please don't steal the reflect from a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>!

- Use <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> strategically to block the <Control name="Knockback"/> attacks.

- Save a <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> or <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> for the expanding AoE so you can deal continues DPS during the mid burn.

- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss in a coordinated team.

</Boss>

### **100%**

- If you are not skipping the first Anomaly, you should place the <Skill name="wallofreflection"/> in the middle.

- Again it is recommended to start on scepter or sword.

- Use your <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and boost the party DPS as soon as Artsariiv arrives at the corners.

- Always use <Skill name="Bindingblade"/> and <Skill name="Whirlingwrath"/> inside Artsariivs hitbox for big damage.

### _Adds_

- Swap to scepter and camp it to be ready for the mid burst.

- Do not waste your <Skill name="banesignet"/> or <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> (GS5) for this.

- Use your <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to quickly navigate to adds.

### **66% and 33%**

- When all adds are broken, your traps will be off cooldown again.

- Start on scepter again, use <Skill name="Shield of Wrath"/> to block the expanding AoE and fire everything you have.

- When Artsariiv arrives at the corners again immediately place your <Skill name="Wall of reflection"/>.

-   Play scepter on this encounter

- Place markers for the blooms

- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss.

- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss if you are using a portal.

</Boss>

### **Synopsis**

- Play scepter here!

- Good teams: start on scepter/sword, so that you are on scepter during the bloom phase.

- Bad teams: start on greatsword and do SC rotation

- Your goal is to start on scepter/sword at every 10% burn phase, that is why you need to consider weapon swaps carefully.

- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> to pull adds. Do not abuse it to farm DPS! Not pulling the adds might kill you during the bloom phase and cost more DPS!

- Timings to use <Skill name="banesignet"/>:

  1.  Use it two times at the singularity before the encounter starts.

  2.  Use it slightly before phase 3, 5 and 6 start.

- There are two ways to do the blooms fast:

  1.  Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the scepter. Use <Skill name="Wings of Resolve"/> to jump back to the middle.

  2.  Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the greatsword. After the bloom bounces towards the pillar use <Skill name="Leap of faith"/> on the bloom to finish it. Immediately use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to jump back into the middle.

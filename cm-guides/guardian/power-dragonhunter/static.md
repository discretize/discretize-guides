### **General Knowledge**

<Warning>
Many of the following tips can also be found on the original <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> guide page, as well as complementary tips on symbol precasts, and more <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Dragonhunter"/> tips. *Make sure to check the* ***Advanced*** *of the <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> section to get a full perspective*.
</Warning>

#### **Common tips to improve on <Specialization name="Guardian" text="Guardian"/>**
Major tips are listed in the **Advanced Tips** section of the ***Advanced*** page of the <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> guide.


#### **Mistlock precasts**
- If playing **Radiance**, always precast <Skill name="hallowedground"/> and <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for  <Boon name="resolution"/> uptime. Blasts can we done with two abilities,  <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> and  <Skill name="holystrike"/> or  <Skill name="mightyblow"/>. Precast  <Skill name="feelmywrath"/>.
- If playing **Virtues**, make sure to also cast  <Skill name="saveyourselves"/> Over  <Skill name="hallowedground"/>, or both if you can afford to do so on your precasting template.
- Tip for **Virtues**: casting "Save Yourselves!" and pressing the Singularity at the same Time will allow for multiple casts of the ability.

#### **Trap Precasts** 

- All traps but  <Skill name="lightsjudgment"/> and  <Skill name="processionofblades"/> remain on the ground upon switching between Dragonhunter templates only. Sometimes, you may want to precast  <Skill name="procession of blades"/> on a boss' location, in which case you will have to have  <Skill name="hallowedground"/> both on your precasting template (if you have one), and on your actual template you want to use during the fight. Make sure to always have the same exact traits on both templates, otherwise you will be struck by the infamous *Status Reset*.

#### **A reminder on Symbol Precasts**

*Symbol Precasts* is the name given to the action of going through different weapons, and casting as many symbols as possible before an encounter begins. This can significantly improve the <Specialization name="Guardian" text="Guardian"/>'s initial burst and, consequently, its overall damage at the end of the fight (provided the boss is killed quickly enough). This technique is especially useful for boss kill records and fractal speedruns, but mostly anectodal in daily runs. 

**Disclaimer: precasting symbols is risky in unorganized runs, as you never know when a player will activate the boss. It needs practice and a conciliant party.**
Here are a few practical tips in order to achieve proper symbol precasting:
- Switching from a weapon to another weapon will always interrupt any ongoing action. Make sure to always finish casting your symbols before changing to a different weapon. The best way to achieve symbol precasting is to switch from weapon to weapon using an opened Inventory.
- In the Inventory, position the weapons you need in a straight line or in a square shape at the very top of it; find something practical for you for frequent use. Make sure you have a fifth slot for the focus as well, so it *always* drops down in the right place every time you equip and unequip it. The use of Ascended weapons is an absolute must. Do NOT share any ascended weapons between templates. Make sure to have unique ascended weapons for each template you need.
- The priority when passing through different weapons to precast symbols is: *Scepter → Sword + Focus → Staff → Longbow*. If starting the boss on *Greatsword*, you can replace *Longbow* with it in this priority list.
-  To make things easier, always equip your *Scepter* and *Focus* **beforehand**, over the weapon you would usually start the encounter with. *Scepter* always comes first. If you wish to add a fifth symbol, you can equip a *Mace* instead, and it can be cast as you traverse a portal to the boss. Switch to *Scepter*, cast as <Skill name="symbolofpunishment"/>, then switch to *Sword*, cast <Skill name="symbolofblades"/> and <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> as it goes off, then *Staff* (<Skill name="symbolofswiftness"/>), *Longbow* (<Skill name="symbolofenergy"/>), and finally your weapon of choice and its symbol for the start of the encounter.

Many examples of symbol precasting can be found in the subsequent video, linked below for every boss encounter.

<Warning>
- This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. It is recommended to use extra CC skills to make up for the potential lack of CC of your team mates, such as <Skill name="banesignet"/>.
- It is possible to precast a <Skill id="30273"/> on the second Knight, if a portal to go back is available.
- <Trait name="heavylight"/> is required.
</Warning>

### **Synopsis**
- Start the boss on *Longbow*. It is recommended not to precast more than 2 symbols on MAMA (aim for the edge of the hitbox, to the left of the boss upon walking to it), preferably *Sword* and *Scepter*.
- Try to use your full burst in each phase after the defiance bar is broken.
- Don't forget that you can not expect to see the highest numbers without the breakbar being frequently broken: to make that happen use <Skill name="banesignet"/>.
- Do not use traps on the adds.
- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> *inside* the first knight's hitbox, and then in MAMA's hitbox during fight, when the small adds are coming close.
- Feel free to use <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> and <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/> for faster movement.

<Warning>
- <Skill name="bindingblade"/> can be abused here. After Ensolyss body slams the party, a bunch of shadow echos will appear on every player, locking them with a delayed damaging AoE. These echos act just like adds and can be bound by <Skill name="bindingblade"/>. They stay up for a short period of time. The following rotation does not take this into account and uses binding blade earlier, in order not to delay the second round of *Longbow* abilities.
- Both <Trait name="biggamehunter"/> and <Trait name="heavylight"/> can be used here, but the latter should be slightly worse, as Ensolyss is a tanky boss which doesn't easily spend most of its time CCd.
</Warning>

### **Synopsis**

- Start on *Longbow*.
- Breakbar should be broken at the start of the fight, use <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> and then <Skill name="deflectingshot"/> to help to make it happen.
- Try to fit every single skill you have into <Effect name="Exposed"> (few seconds after the bar is broken), feel free to precast a symbol, and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before Ensolyss becomes vulnerable.</Effect>
- After you used your full opener, continue with your usual rotation until you phase.
- Repeat this every single phase.

<Warning>
- It is recommended to play with the *Major Adept* trait <Trait name="soaringdevastation"/> over <Trait name="piercinglight"/>, for additional CC with <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/>.
- Play with <Trait name="heavylight"/>, as you will be using <Skill name="huntersverdict"/> (F1) for CC.
- Using <Skill name="renewedfocus"/> will allow you to get more CC out of your virtues <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/> (F2) and <Skill name="huntersverdict"/> (F1).
- Save your <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> (F3) for the expanding AoE, so you and your party can deal continued damage during the mid burn phase.
- Start the boss on *Greatsword* for P1.

<InformationBlock title="Specific Precasts">

*With a portal at your disposal*: precast two traps on Artsariiv’s add locations for CC: <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> and <Skill name="purification"/>, in which case, you will want to run with the usual trait <Trait name="piercinglight"/>. The <Condition name="slow"/> <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> applies is valuable, too (200 CC over 4 seconds, 275 CC if traited), and so is the <Condition name="blinded"/> from <Skill name="purification"/>, (as well as the <Condition name="slow"/> if traited). You can keep <Skill name="fragmentsoffaith"/> and <Skill name="testoffaith"/> for damage on Artsariiv. Cast those on her usual path to the north-west corner. If a custom CC distribution without <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> is used, it can also be cast for damage on the same spot as <Skill name="testoffaith"/> and <Skill name="fragmentsoffaith"/> as it is a strong damaging ability. In that case, double-proc it with an additional <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> cast, while on *Longbow*, to proc <Item name="severance"/> and triple the damage from <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/>. <Skill name="processionofblades"/> can also be precasted on the edge of Artsariiv’s hitbox. Artsariiv will also walk through your <Skill name="testoffaith"/>'s damaging ring, for additional burst.

*Tips:*  
- Cancel the <Skill name="bindingblade"/> aftercast with <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> in P1, while going through Artsariiv’s hitbox. Try to stand within it, as close as you can to the west-most edge of the platform, as your <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> healing will proc much more easily on this side (<Effect name="Agony"/> from Artsariiv's beam is avoided).
- Use <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> whenever it is off cooldown, for additional <Boon name="resolution"/> uptime (usually before P2 and P3).
- precasts: three to four symbols (*Scepter*, *Sword* + *Focus*, *Staff*, *Longbow*) before Artsariiv spawns (start casting them shortly after the marble is triggered).

*Tips:*
- It's best to start casting a couple of skills just before Artsariiv becomes vulnerable to steal some time, allowing you to fit more skills in. Start with <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> and <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>.
- <Skill name="bindingblade"/> actually hits twice on Artsariiv during mid burn phases, so make sure to cast it inside the boss' hitbox.
- Press <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/> uptime.
- If done correctly, you should be able to fit in all of the listed abilities in the rotation.
- Make sure to switch back again to *Longbow* as the second split begins, to avoid cooldown issues on your weapon swap.
- <Skill name="bindingblade"/> can be kept in favor of CC, and used at the start of the split between two adds, before switching back to *Longbow*.
- <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> allows the whole party to avoid Artsariiv's slam to the ground, a huge expanding AoE as the phase begins. It is important to position properly, behind Artsariiv, on the very edge of her red hitbox indicator.

<Warning>
Arkk is a very machinal and straight-forward boss. The efficiency of every phase DPS check is heavily dependent on solid individual DPS rotations. This is why it requires some experience over time, in order to master it.

It is especially important to learn a good rotation and stick to it. In the following guide section, one rotation is described.  Here are some import tips:
- Place markers down for the blooms.
- Precast your traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss.
- You can easily push blooms using <Skill id="30471"/> from afar, or going in with a <Skill name="strike"/> followed by a <Skill name="leapoffaith"/>. Come back to the center of the platform using your special action key, for an additional <Boon name="might"/> blast and quick repositioning.
- <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> (Gs3) can have its leap effect cancelled using the special action key on your position.
- Do not wait for the boss to target it. In fact, it is preferred not to target it at all in P1, and throw all of your burst without aim, facing down and pointing your cursor to the boss' location, as shown in the video; as if you were playing with *Action Camera*! All of your abilities, including the *Longbow* projectiles, should hit.
- <Trait name="heavylight"/> and <Trait name="biggamehunter"/> are both viable options, although <Trait name="heavylight"/> is much easier to play. For the purposes of the guide, the rotation with <Trait name="biggamehunter"/> is presented. The same rotation without the use of <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> is to be used if playing with <Trait name="heavylight"/>. 

</Warning>

<InformationBlock title="Specific Precasts">

*Advanced tips, with a portal at your disposal*: precast two to three traps on connected sides for orb pushing: two on your ledge (<Skill name="fragmentsoffaith"/> left, <Skill name="purification"/> right) and <Skill name="testoffaith"/> on the furthest side of the ledge to your left. In other words, picture 8 possible trap locations, two on each side of every platform ledge. The right-most location, facing your own ledge, is location 1. From there, rotate counterclockwise and place one trap on locations 1, 2 and 4). Traps are cast about midway between orb locations and tower locations, slightly closer to the edge than inside the platform. Preferably, you should be assigned West or East. Precast <Skill name="processionofblades"/> and <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> on Arkk's location. If possible, precast three to four symbols.

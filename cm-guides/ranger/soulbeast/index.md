<Message>
This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. Especially at this fight it is recommended to grab [consumables](/guides/consumables) to make up for the lack of CC of your team mates. 
</Message>
- Pet: <Skill id="43636" disableText/> Rock Gazelle.
- Take <Trait id="2143"/>.
- It makes sense to use [consumables](/guides/consumables) on the adds!
</Boss>

<Message>
The timing of <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> later on in the fight will depend on your groups DPS and when you first cast it. If it is off cooldown at the start of phase 3 use it then. If not use it after you have casted <Skill name="Barrage"/> on P4.
</Message>

<Message>
Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect. Outside of your burst use skills with shorter cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns to line up and try not to get stuck auto attacking on Longbow.

- In faster kills you want to run <Item id="82876"/> instead of <Item id="24615"/> on longbow.
- If you don't trust your group to deal DPS in phase 2 then you can take <Trait id="2128"/> and use <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> when you return to MAMA in phase 2. The reason for this is because in phase 1, 3 and 4 you have the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>, so compensating with <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> can help the team phase MAMA faster here.

</Boss>

<Message>
The timing of <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> in this fight will depend on your group. If your group has low DPS and/or is running into the fight use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> just before the CC bar appears on P1 and again at the start of P3. If your group is portalling into the fight and has reasonable DPS cast <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> as late as you can in the precast, then save it for the start of P2.
</Message>
<Message>
If your P1 is slow you may have time to swap to Greatsword for the first split phase. When you go back to Siax use <Skill id="46629"/> -> <Skill name="Path of Scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> to burst into <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
</Message>
<Message>
Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect. Outside of your burst use skills with shorter cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns to line up.
</Message>

- Use <Skill name="Call of the Wild"/> to blast <Boon name="Might"/>, then use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>.
- Take Mistlock and swap to Longbow.
- Summon <Skill name="Frost spirit"/>.
- Cast <Skill name="Barrage"/> and swap to Greatsword as the yellow cast bar appears.

### **1st Phase**

- <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> as soon as your first trap procs so you have both ticking at the same time.
- <Skill name="Sicem"/> as soon as Siax is targetable.
- <Skill id="46629"/> -> <Skill name="Worldly Impact"/> -> <Skill id="41524"/> before the breakbar.
- <Skill id="45743"/> followed by <Skill name="Hilt Bash"/> to CC (If the bar hasn't broken use a [consumable](/guides/consumables) to help).
- Burst with <Skill id="46629"/> -> <Skill name="Path of Scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>.
 
### _1st Add_

- Weapon swap and use <Skill id="46629"/> -> <Skill name="Hilt Bash"/> -> <Skill id="46629"/> and your pet skills to finish the phase.

- <Skill name="sicem"/> once Siax is vulnerable.
- Burst with <Skill id="46629"/> -> <Skill name="Path of Scars"/> -> <Skill name="Frost trap"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>.
- Auto attack and use your pet skills as they come off cooldown until Siax is dead.
- In a group with low DPS you will have time to swap back to Greatsword, so finish the fight with <Skill id="46629"/> -> <Skill name="Hilt Bash"/> -> <Skill id="46629"/>.
- You might also have to break a CC bar in this phase so try to use <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="Path of Scars"/>, <Skill name="hiltbash"/> or even [consumables](/guides/consumables) to help.

The following guide is assuming your group doesn't instabreak the first CC bar. If you are going to instabreak you should refer to the static opener then follow the rest of the rotation from this guide.
</Message>
<Message>
Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect.

Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect. Outside of your burst use skills with shorter cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns to line up and try not to get stuck auto attacking on Longbow.

Spirit Management:
- If you run with a healer you can summon it on the platform and you can forget about it as it will probably stay alive the whole fight (Obviously if it dies resummon it!).
- If you run without it depends on how your <Specialization name ="Renegade"/> plays, if they precast <Skill id="45686"/> before Skorvald spawns then you can summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down on the boss platform after the precast and the Kalla heal skill will sustain it until the second phase. In this scenario you don't teleport it at all you just leave it behind.
- If they don't do this then you will want to summon the spirit next to the Boss Challenge Mote and let it tick down in health for a couple of ticks and then pull it firstly down to Skorvald after the precast and then to the first island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> in order to kill it so it is back up for island 4 to be resummoned. This is the method described in the guide below.

If you group is going to skip the first anomaly, follow the rotation for side strat in the static section.
</Message>
<Message>
This guide assumes you are going to let your group kill the 2nd and 3rd anomalies or skip them completely. If you get the bomb don't panic. Attempt to get the reflect and then if you have time special action key to the dome or /gg! If your group can't kill the anomaly without you you can still attempt to reflect. When you get to the side use <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/>, quickly weapon swap and <Skill name="Path of Scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>.
</Message>
<Message>
If your group has fast or organised CC on the split phases, your <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> probably won't be off cooldown in the middle. If this is the case use <Skill name="pathofscars"/> and swap to Longbow and proc <Item id="84505"/> with <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/>. Then use <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/> and your pet skills.

- Pet: <Skill id="44617" disableText/> Red Moa.
- Take <Trait id="2128"/>.
- Swap to <Item id="50082"/>!
- If you are good at tagging multiple targets then you can even run <Item id="43360"/>.
- Resummon your <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> whenever you have downtime when you can't attack (i.e. whilst you are waiting for Arkk, the Archdiviner or Gladiator to spawn on the platform or during an orb phase if you have the time).
- Wherever possible you should try to hit multiple targets with your <Skill name="Pathofscars"/>. (This can mean hitting an anomaly to help your <Specialization name="renegade"/> kill it.)

<Warning>

Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect.

<Warning>

The timing of <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> in this fight will depend on your group. If your group has low DPS and/or is running into the fight use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> just before the CC bar appears on P1 and again at the start of P3.

</Warning>

<Warning>

Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC!

### **2nd Phase**

- You might also have to break a CC bar in this phase so try to use <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="Path of Scars"/>, <Skill name="hiltbash"/> to help.

<Boss name="skorvald" video="o7R-tnLH4ws" videoCreator="Elu" foodId="91805" utilityId="9443" healId="31914" utility1Id="12633" utility2Id="12497" utility3Id="12492" eliteId="45717" weapon1MainAffix="Berserker" weapon1MainType="Longbow" weapon1MainSigil1="force" weapon1MainSigil2="Impact" weapon1MainInfusion1Id="37131" weapon1MainInfusion2Id="37131" weapon2OffAffix="Berserker" weapon2OffType="Axe" weapon2OffSigil="Impact" weapon2OffInfusionId="37131" weapon2MainAffix="Berserker" weapon2MainType="Sword" weapon2MainSigil1="Force" weapon2MainInfusion1Id="37131">

</Boss>

<Warning>

Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect. Outside of your burst use skills with shorter cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns to line up and try not to get stuck auto attacking on Longbow.

</Warning>

<Warning>

Spirit Management:

- If you run with a healer you can summon it on the platform and you can forget about it as it will probably stay alive the whole fight (Obviously if it dies resummon it!).
- If you run without it depends on how your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> plays, if they precast <Skill id="45686"/> before Skorvald spawns then you can summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down on the boss platform after the precast and the Kalla heal skill will sustain it until the second phase. In this scenario you don't teleport it at all you just leave it behind.
- If they don't do this then you will want to summon the spirit next to the Boss Challenge Mote and let it tick down in health for a couple of ticks and then pull it firstly down to Skorvald after the precast and then to the first island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> in order to kill it so it is back up for island 4 to be resummoned. This is the method described in the guide below.

</Warning>

### **Precast**

- When you are activating the Boss Challenge Mote run down to the boss platform and precast <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> on the boss like a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> in disguise. Then /gg and wait up by the Mote until you are ready to precast.
- Use <Skill name="Moa Stance"/>.
- <Skill name="Call of the Wild" /> to blast <Boon name="Might" />, <Skill name="One Wolf Pack" /> then take _Mistlock Singularity_ and <Skill name="Call of the Wild" /> again.
- Swap to Longbow and run to the platform. As you run summon your <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/>.
- Cast <Skill name="Barrage"/>.

### **100%-66%**

- When your first <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> procs cast it again and use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/>.
- As soon as Skorvald is targetable, use <Skill name="Sicem"/>, <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> and <Skill id="45743"/> to CC.
- <Skill name="Path of Scars" /> and then <Skill name="Whirlingdefense" /> into <Effect name="Exposed" />.
- Use <Skill name="Worldly Impact"/>, auto attack and your pet skills if Skorvald hasn't phased.
- Place a portal if you volunteered to do 66%.
- Use <Skill name="Hornet Sting"/> to get to the first island once it is phased.

### _Islands_

- Remember to use <Skill name="We Heal as One"/> to keep up boons.
- Use <Skill name="Worldlyimpact"/> and autoattacks to kill the first add.
- You can use <Skill name="whirlingdefense"/> on the 2nd one after it jumps.
- Swap to longbow and kill the 3rd add with <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> and <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/>.
- As soon as you land on the last island, open portal if you placed it. Help to kill the last add and use <Skill id="45743"/> or <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> to proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/>.
- Take the portal early to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> before Skorvald becomes vulnerable.

### **66%-33%**

- <Skill name="Frosttrap" />, <Skill name="Sicem" />.
- <Skill name="One Wolf Pack" /> as your party arrive through the portal.
- <Skill name="Worldly Impact" /> then weaponswap.
- <Skill name="pathofscars" /> -> <Skill name="Whirlingdefense" />.
- If Skorvald doesn't phase carry on with the normal rotation.

### **33%-0%**

- Same as 66% to 33%.

</Boss>

<Warning>

If you group is going to skip the first anomaly, follow the rotation for side strat in the static section.

</Warning>

<Warning>

This guide assumes you are going to let your group kill the 2nd and 3rd anomalies or skip them completely. If you get the bomb don't panic. Attempt to get the reflect and then if you have time special action key to the dome or /gg! If your group can't kill the anomaly without you you can still attempt to reflect. When you get to the side use <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/>, quickly weapon swap and <Skill name="Path of Scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>.

</Warning>

<Warning>

If your group has fast or organised CC on the split phases, your <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> probably won't be off cooldown in the middle. If this is the case use <Skill name="pathofscars"/> and swap to Longbow and proc <Item id="84505"/> with <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/>. Then use <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/> and your pet skills.

</Warning>

<Warning>

Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect. Outside of your burst use skills with shorter cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns to line up and try not to get stuck auto attacking on Longbow.

</Warning>

### **66-33%**

### **33 to 0%**

- Repeat the same rotation as 66-33%.

- Take <Trait id="2128"/>.
- Swap to <Item id="50082"/>!
- Resummon your <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> whenever you have downtime when you can't attack (i.e. whilst you are waiting for Arkk, the Archdiviner or Gladiator to spawn on the platform or during an orb phase if you have the time).
- Wherever possible you should try to hit multiple targets with your <Skill name="Pathofscars"/>. (This can mean hitting an anomaly to help your <Specialization name="renegade"/> kill it.)
- You can also pull the adds from the Archdiviner and Gladiator phase since your <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> can only pull two at a time.
- Pulling the adds is also great since they can hurt your teams <Item id="24836"/> uptime.
- If you drop on quickness for some reason, make sure to use <Skill name="Worldlyimpact"/> before bursting to get yourself some.

</Boss>

<Warning>

Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect. Outside of your burst use skills with shorter cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns to line up and try not to get stuck auto attacking on Longbow.

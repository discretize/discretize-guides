- If you don't trust your group to deal DPS in phase 2 then you can take <Trait id="2128"/> and use <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> when you return to MAMA in phase 2. The reason for this is because in phase 1, 3 and 4 you have the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>, so compensating with <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> can help the team phase MAMA faster here.

- With good instabilities, use <Item id="73191"/> as Utility food.

- You can swap <Item id="24868"/> for <Item id="24661"/> in your longbow if you want.

</Boss>

<Warning>
Your rotation will depend on your groups DPS and ability to CC! In general make sure you have as many damage modifiers up as you can when you do your burst and try to time it with the <Effect name="Exposed"/> effect. Outside of your burst use skills with shorter cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns to line up and try not to get stuck auto attacking on Longbow.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Spirit Management:

- If you run with a healer you can summon it on the platform and you can forget about it as it will probably stay alive the whole fight (Obviously if it dies resummon it!).

- If you run without it depends on how your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> plays, if they precast <Skill id="45686"/> before Skorvald spawns then you can summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down on the boss platform after the precast and the Kalla heal skill will sustain it until the second phase. In this scenario you don't teleport it at all you just leave it behind.

- If they don't do this then you will want to summon the spirit next to the Boss Challenge Mote and let it tick down in health for a couple of ticks and then pull it firstly down to Skorvald after the precast and then to the first island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> in order to kill it so it is back up for island 4 to be resummoned. This is the method described in the guide below.

</Warning>

- Cast <Skill name="Barrage"/>.

### **100%-66%**

- <Skill name="Path of Scars"/> and then <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/> into <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

- Use <Skill name="Worldly Impact"/>, auto attack and your pet skills if Skorvald hasn't phased.

- Place a portal if you volounteered to do 66%.

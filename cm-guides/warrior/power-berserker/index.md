<Message>
This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. Especially at this fight it is recommended to grab extra CC skills to make up for the lack of CC of your team mates. 
</Message>
This guide is a PuG friendly version without banner precast. Please remember that CCing all bars fast is the most important bit in this fight. You won't get a good kill - might even wipe your party - if you greed DPS without CC. 

There is an invisible hitbox in the center of the arena allowing you to gain enough adrenaline for one <Skill name="decapitate"/> with only two critical hits!

- Shortly before MAMA becomes vulnerable use <Skill name="mending"/>.
- Precast <Skill name="Tremor"/> for CC.
- Use <Skill name="headbutt"/> to CC quickly.
- Engage <Skill name="Berserk"/>.
- Swap.
- <Skill name="decapitate"/>, continue as usual.

### _1st Add_

- CC with <Skill name="Wildblow"/>.

### **2nd Phase**

- Normal rotation according to the guide.
- Don't break this bar.

### _2nd Add_

- Swap to Maces.
- <Skill name="skullgrinder"/>.
- <Skill name="Mending"/> shortly before the add dies.

### **3rd Phase**

- <Skill name="Tremor"/>, <Skill name="wildblow"/>.
- Swap to Axes as soon as possible.
- Normal rotation according to the guide.

### _3rd Add_

This guide assumes you kill MAMA in less about 45 seconds (p1 break). The CC-distribution greatly changes depending on the speed the party is going. 

If there is any doubt about the kill time, go with the PuG version. The following guide assumes you are following the proposed [CC-Distribution](/guides/cc-distribution).

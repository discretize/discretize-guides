## What is necessary to clear fractals efficiently?

It boils down to five important concepts that need to be fulfilled permanently while in combat. Failing one of these will decelerate the speed and smoothness of the run:

1. Boons: 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>.
2. Conditions: 25 stacks of <Condition name="vulnerability"/>, along with any unique condis that your class needs to gain damage modifiers.
3. Breaking [CC bars](guides/cc-distribution) to gain the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
4. High and fast group single target burst potential.
5. Using strong damaging class skills such as <Skill name="Spider Venom"/> or <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>

<Warning>
It is vital to understand that these concepts in conjunction create massive amounts of burst causing phases to only last a few seconds (even with condi classes). This is also due to the fact that the <Effect name="Exposed"/> modifier stacks multiplicative with many other damage modifiers.

The gameplay is therefore much more fast paced compared to raids and requires different thinking and rotations that are tailored around the <Effect name="Exposed"/> window.
</Warning>

For T4s there are several other important concepts:

1. Projectile reflects and <Boon name="Stability"/>.
2. High cleave damage.
3. Fast movement using leaps, blinks and teleports to perform skips for the team.
4. <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip trash mobs.

## What and how do I play in PuGs?

PuGs rarely play optimally as a group, causing people to generally deal lower damage and perform worse overall due to lack of synergy. If you are one of those that seek to improve we highly encourage you to find a static via our `#looking-for-static` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NpS2gN5) or [apply to Discretize](apply). We encourage the fractal community to strive for self-improvement and help in any possible way on our Discord server or in-game.

For people without the time to do this, we recommend quite an open comp when using the in-game lfg. Whilst every class in the game has multiple strong builds for fractals, it is still important to build your party around certain boons to help have a somewhat efficient clear.

By building your party around the following concepts you will find an in-game lfg run in most cases is much faster and smoother than just taking any old build. You first want to look at covering the important boons: <Boon name="Might" text="25 Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. Also you want to aim as a group to be able to maintain <Condition name="vulnerability" text="25 Vulnerability"/> on your targets. Finally builds that can bring high CC and damage mitigation such as reflects, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> are much more beneficial to run than pure damage dealers.

Along with huge amounts of <Effect name="barrier"/> generation and great utility it makes it currently the strongest heal build in fractals.<br/><BuildLink build="Condi Alac Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> provides 100% <Boon name="Alacrity"/> uptime, and around 13 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, strong utilities in terms of heavy crowd control, damage mitigation and decent DPS on its own. Due to its self sustain and higher damage over time we recommend this build for <Specialization name="Renegade"/> in most PuG groups.<br/><BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> provides 100% <Boon name="Alacrity"/> uptime, and around 10 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, strong utilities in terms of heavy crowd control and damage mitigation. In the right hands it can deal good damage but in most PuG groups Condi Alac Renegade will be higher damage.<br/><BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/> provides 100% <Boon name="Alacrity"/> uptime, 5 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and around 75% <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime. Alongside this, <Specialization name="Specter"/> provides a large amount of <Effect name="Barrier"/> and healing to your party and it can also boonstrip <Instability name="No Pain No Gain"/>. Although <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> are lacking, if this is covered by other party members, <Specialization name="Specter"/> can be a strong choice. <br/><BuildLink build="Power Mechanist" specialization="Mechanist"/> provides 100% <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/> and 25 <Boon name="Might"/>. It also provides some <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Effect name="Barrier"/>, 1 stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> and a single <Boon name="Aegis"/>. It is a very simple build to play making it ideal for new players with an easy rotation dealing solid damage and easy boon generation. However, it lacks CC and defensive support compared to <Specialization name="Renegade"/>.<br/>There are also other <Boon name="Alacrity"/> providers such as <Specialization name="Untamed" text="Alacrity Untamed"/> or <Specialization name="Tempest" text="Heal Alac Tempest"/> that can be played, we do not currently have pages for them on the site. This does not mean that they are bad, but may be situationally strong, or require the group to compensate for support or damage with other roles. |

It can even provide <Boon name="Resistance"/> for a short time with tomes. If your party is new and tank lots of damage, this is a strong build to play.<br/><BuildLink build="Celestial Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> provides 100% <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime, 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, utilities in terms of crowd control, reflects, shared <Boon name="Aegis"/> and medium DPS. It can even provide <Boon name="Resistance"/> for a short time with tomes. This makes fractals effortless by providing all the important boons a Heal Firebrand can, a decent amount of passive and on demand healing, whilst dealing some damage.<br/><BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> provides 100% <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime, utilities in terms of crowd control, reflects, shared <Boon name="Aegis"/> and medium DPS. It can even provide <Boon name="Resistance"/> for a short time with tomes. This build deals high dps while bringing massive support. It can also share <Boon name="Quickness"/> with a second <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> allowing for even more support utilities to be run.<br/><BuildLink build="Power Scrapper" specialization="Scrapper"/> provides 100% <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime, around 13 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, and a large amount of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.

## What are the differences between the organized groups and how PuGs play?

One of the biggest differences is, that they don't always understand how their actions translate into the game. Learning to do the mechanics correctly, flawlessly, and reliably is - in the beginning - the most important task. PuGs assume the worst usually, so one player in the party is a healer instead.

Another difference is that PuGs often claim, that CC is solely the job of the <Specialization name="Renegade"/>. That is not true since <Specialization name="Renegade"/> can only knock out **about half** of the bars. CC is a group effort involving **all** party members, **EVEN IN CONDI COMPS!**

Many PuGs like to play <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> or <Specialization name="Scourge"/>. That is just fine as you don't know what to expect of your fellow PuG mates and you prefer to be self-sufficient. But please don't be afraid to run more supportive skills such as <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> or <Skill name="Spectral Grasp"/>! It is more worth it than the +500 DPS you gain from having a minor dps utility instead.

Low Standards \[LS] is a community discord server, that is operating as a second, more restricted LFG for no heal daily runs.

Thanks to different pingable roles and class-emojis, members are able to organize their run without the commitment of a static or any need of LFG waiting times.

In order to guarantee a high level of play, everyone needs to be capable of executing strategies inside of a no-heal environment with at least one of the meta-classes.
For evaluation, we are going to ask new applicants for arcdps logs as a requirement.

## What are strong comps for organised groups?

<Warning>
It is important to note, that each challenge mote encounter has a different effective composition, which is often different to the proposed compositions below. Discretize focuses on clearing daily fractals efficiently, and the proposed compositions brings enough utility to deal with all situations that are occurring in fractals without needing to relog to another character for every boss or fractal. To see examples of these check out the [dT Daily Comps](/guides/daily-comp).

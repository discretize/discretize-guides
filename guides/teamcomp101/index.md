## What is necessary to clear fractals efficiently?

It boils down to five essential concepts a group must fulfill permanently in combat. Failing one of these will decelerate the speed and smoothness of the run:

1. Boons: 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>.
2. Conditions: 25 stacks of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and any unique conditions your class needs to gain damage modifiers.
3. Breaking [CC bars](guides/cc-distribution) to gain the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
4. High and fast group single target burst potential.
5. Using strong damaging class skills such as <Skill name="Spider Venom"/> or <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>

<Warning>
It is vital to understand that these concepts, in conjunction, create massive bursts, causing phases to only last a few seconds - even with condition classes. The <Effect name="Exposed"/> modifier also stacks multiplicatively with many other damage modifiers, reinforcing this effect.

Therefore, the gameplay is much more fast-paced than raids and requires different thinking and rotations tailored around the <Effect name="Exposed"/> window.
</Warning>

For T4s, there are several other important concepts: 

1. Projectile reflects and <Boon name="Stability"/>. 
2. High cleave damage.
3. Fast movement using leaps, blinks, and teleports to perform skips for the team.
4. <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip trash mobs.

## What and how do I play in PuGs? 

PuGs rarely play optimally as a group, causing people to generally deal lower damage and perform worse overall due to a lack of synergy. If you are one of those who seek to improve, we highly encourage you to find a static via our `#looking-for-static` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NpS2gN5) or [apply to Discretize](apply). We encourage the fractal community to strive for self-improvement and help in any possible way on our Discord server or in-game.

For people without the time to do this, we recommend quite an open comp when using the in-game LFG. While every class in the game has multiple strong builds for fractals, building your party around certain boons is still vital to help have a somewhat efficient clear.

By choosing builds that complement each other to bring the necessary boons, conditions, CC, and support, a run will typically be a smoother, more enjoyable experience than one without these things. You first goal is to cover the important boons: <Boon name="Might" text="25 Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. Additionally, you as a group should aim to maintain <Condition name="vulnerability" text="25 Vulnerability"/> on your targets. Finally, builds that can bring high CC and damage mitigation, such as reflects, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> are much more beneficial to run than pure damage dealers.

<Warning>
The compositions below are robust options with support builds that synergize well and are capable of handling all fractal mechanics, leading to quick, consistent, and smooth runs at all gameplay levels. Every class in the game has at least one option for a boon heal, boon DPS, power DPS, and condition DPS build sufficient to play in fractals, which can be an alternate option to the builds below.

We want to note however, that boon builds such as <Specialization name="Mechanist"/>, <Specialization name="Druid"/>, or <Specialization name="Tempest"/> while providing all of the necessary boon support and healing, can sometimes have less access to damage mitigation or only one skill that provides <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>. The reduced damage mitigation is no issue if other people in your party recognize it and adapt their play-style or builds to help. However, if their attitude is for the healer to carry the group, these builds can be much more complicated to play effectively.
</Warning> 

### Example Power Composition
Typically, we play power compositions on most normal mode fractals, Nightmare CM and Shattered Observatory CM.
| | |
|-|-|
| <Specialization name="Chronomancer" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Heal Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> is one of the strongest, if not the strongest heal build currently for fractals. It can provide either <Boon name="Alacrity"/> or <Boon name="Quickness"/>, as well as 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/>. It has multiple options for on-demand <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>, as well as other mitigation such as reflects, plenty of condi cleanse, and Crowd Control. Finally, it has a unique toolkit for T4s with access to blinks and movement abilities for skips along with <Effect name="Stealth"/> and some <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. This composition uses it as an <Boon name="Alacrity"/> provider. <br/> **Alternative Options** - If the heal spot serves as a <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider, or you are in a no heal group. We recommend playing <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> or <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Power Alacrity Willbender"/> in this slot.|
| <Specialization name="Scrapper" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Power Scrapper" specialization="Scrapper"/> is a strong <Boon name="Quickness"/> DPS option. It provides large amounts of Crowd Control, <Effect name="Stealth"/>, and <Effect name="Superspeed"/>, making T4 fractals easy. It also has High target and cleave damage, along with Boon stip on <Skill name="Throw Mine"/> effectively dealing with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>. Through <Skill name="Blast Gyro"/>, it is also capable of helping maintain party <Boon name="Might"/>. <br/> **Alternative Options** - For a more defensive option <BuildLink build="Power Herald" specialization="Herald"/> can be taken. Or, if you have a <Boon name="Alacrity"/> DPS provider, <BuildLink build="Heal Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> or <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand"  specialization="Firebrand"/> can be played as a <Boon name="Quickness"/> heal option. |
| Power DPS | The final three spots are for pure DPS builds. In PuGs, whether a build is META or not doesn't matter. All that matters is if the build is good, which every class in the game can make. A good build has an equipment combination, traits, and skills that make sense for the encounter it is being played on. Try to pick a build that complements the rest of the party and be willing to compromise if the boon supports need extra help with situational boons (such as <Boon name="Stability"/> or <Boon name="Aegis"/>), condi cleanse, or providing some boon strips if needed. |

### Example Condition Composition
Condition compositions are typically taken on Sunqua Peak CM and Silent Surf CM and can be beneficial to run on some T4s. 
| | |
|-|-|
| <Specialization name="Specter" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/> is a strong condition <Boon name="Alacrity"/> DPS option. It offers competitive damage, along with plenty of CC through <Skill name="Basilisk Venom"/> and <Skill name="Headshot"/> on <Item id="72239" text="Off-hand Pistol"/>. Additionally, <Trait name="Bountiful Theft"/> can be taken to effectively deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>, as well as offering some group healing and support through <Trait name="Consume Shadows"/> and ally targeting with <Item id="76688" text="Scepter"/> skills. <br/> **Alternative Options** - Alternatively <BuildLink build="Condi Alac Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> or <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condition Alacrity Scourge"/> can be played in this slot. Or if you feel like your group doesn't need a full healer, <BuildLink build="Celestial Scourge" specialization="Scourge"/> is a solid hybrid build that is great for more confident groups. If you are playing with a Quickness DPS build, an Alacrity heal build such as <BuildLink build="Heal Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> can be played instead. |
| <Specialization name="Chronomancer" size="big" disable text/> | <BuildLink build="Heal Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> is one of the strongest, if not the strongest heal build currently for fractals. It can provide either <Boon name="Alacrity"/> or <Boon name="Quickness"/>, as well as 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/>. It has multiple options for on-demand <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>, as well as other mitigation such as reflects, plenty of condi cleanse, and Crowd Control. Finally, it has a unique toolkit for T4s with access to blinks and movement abilities for skips along with <Effect name="Stealth"/> and some <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. This composition uses it as an <Boon name="Alacrity"/> provider. <br/> **Alternative Options** - If you are playing with an Alacrity Heal provider <Specialization name="Herald" text="Condition Quickness Herald"/> can be taken, which shares its boons in a massive 600 range and is great on Silent Surf, however it has less access to CC. For a more offensive option, <BuildLink build="Condition Harbinger" specialization="Harbinger"/> is a great choice. <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> is an option with powerful utility. Still, care has to be taken when sharing quickness to ensure high uptime.<BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand"  specialization="Firebrand"/> can also be played as a <Boon name="Quickness"/> heal option. |

## What are the differences between the organized groups and how PuGs play?

One of the most significant differences is that they don't always understand how their actions translate into the game. In the beginning, learning to do the mechanics correctly, flawlessly, and reliably is the most critical task. PuGs usually assume the worst, so one player in the party is a healer, serving as a backup.

Another difference is that PuGs often claim that CC is solely the job of the supports. That is false since they can only knock out **about half** of the bars. CC is a group effort involving **all** party members, **EVEN IN CONDITION COMPS!**

Many PuGs like to play <Specialization name="Virtuoso"/> or <Specialization name="Scourge"/>. That is fine, as you don't know what to expect of your fellow PuG mates and prefer to be self-sufficient. But please don't be afraid to run more supportive skills such as <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> or <Skill name="Spectral Grasp"/>! It is worth more than the +500 DPS you gain from having a minor DPS utility instead.

### Adjusting your gear for the encounter
When playing in PuG groups, you will often find a considerable disparity in damage dealt by players (even when playing the same build). While this doesn't consider differences in rotation, or account augmentations such as <Augmentation name="Mist Attunement 4"/>, adjusting your build to the encounter can significantly impact the damage you are dealing. While you are not forced to do this, if you want to optimize your gameplay, it is an excellent place to start.

If you take <BuildLink build="Power Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/>, the standard setup runs with <Item id="24615"/>, <Item id="24868"/>, <Item id="91805"/>, and <Item id="9443"/>. However, some encounters allow you to use slaying sigils and potions, or you can proc on-kill food. We can see how much the DPS increases by adjusting the build using the [gear optimizer with these settings](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/?s=wmPELQkev1).
 
| Standard Item(s)                                                                  | Optimized Item(s)                                                                      | Damage Increase |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| <Item id="91805"/>                                                                | <Item id="43360"/> (100% Uptime)                                                       | 2%              |
| <Item id="9443"/>                                                                 | <Item id="50082"/>                                                                     | 6.2%            |
| <Item id="91805"/> + <br/> <Item id="9443"/>                                      | <Item id="43360"/> (100% Uptime) + <br/> <Item id="50082"/>                            | 8.5%            |
| <Item id="24868"/> (Only 3%)                                                      | <Item id="24658"/>                                                                     | 6.8%            |
| <Item id="91805"/> + <br/> <Item id="9443"/> + <br/> <Item id="24868"/> (Only 3%) | <Item id="43360"/> (100% Uptime) + <br/> <Item id="50082"/> + <br/> <Item id="24658"/> | 15.9%           |

### Prestacking Boons
Another thing that PuGs sometimes miss is the benefits of a proper prestack. We are not talking about spending ages placing traps in the arena or on the boss spawn or spending time precasting extra weapon skills, but simply before starting an encounter (or mini-boss / mob group in T4s) spending a couple of seconds before starting a fight making sure you have 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. When starting the fight, you will instantly be doing as much damage as possible, casting skills quicker, and getting cool-downs back sooner. It also gives you a significant reserve of boons in case something goes wrong in the fight later, and you miss some applications, allowing you to recover more quickly.

A proper prestack on 100% boon duration will give your party 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> for 40s, and 30s of <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. This can be achieved in around 5 seconds or sometimes less. To do this, you need one player to place a fire field and have everyone use at least one blast finisher. Each blast finisher provides three stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> with a base duration of 20s. At the same time, Your support players should share <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, and then you can start the fight. Check each [build page](/builds) for build-specific prestack skills.

## What are strong comps for organized groups?

<Warning>
It is important to note that each challenge mote encounter has a different effective composition, often distinct from the proposed compositions below. Discretize focuses on clearing daily fractals efficiently, and the proposed compositions bring enough utility to deal with all situations occurring in fractals without needing to re-log to another character for every boss or fractal. Check out the [dT Daily Comps](/guides/daily-comps) to see these examples.
</Warning>

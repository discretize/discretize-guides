## Introduction to fractals
Fractals of the mists or also frequently called FOTM (or just "fracs") are 5-man repeatable endgame dungeon-like content with a large scale of difficulty and rewards. There are 100 levels that are structured into 4 different tiers each consisting out of 25 levels. You can find the portal entrance to fractals in Fort Marriner in Lions Arch. There are no gear requirements for tier 1 fractals allowing anybody to try fractals out.

The higher level the more mechanics are added to fractals, the harder hit enemies but you also receive more loot. Starting from level 20 the players need to deal with <Effect name="Agony"/> which requires <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> to counter effectively. Every level has a recommendation of how much <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> you should have at least. Without <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> you lose a percentage of your HP every second while under the effect of <Effect name="Agony"/>. Click on the <Effect name="Agony"/> icon to learn more about the scaling of the damage by <Effect name="Agony"/>.

<Message>
<Effect name="Agony"/> reduces your healing by 70% per stack. Never use your heal skill while you are under the effect of <Effect name="Agony"/>.
</Message>

Starting with tier 2 the heroes are encountering _Mistlock instabilities_ which add another layer of difficulty. A complete list of _Mistlock instabilities_ and countermeasures can be found at the bottom of this page.
| Tier | max. required <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> | Instabilities | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| 1    | 17  | 0 | This tier is meant as an introduction to fractals. Mechanics and damage are very forgiving. | 
| 2    | 61 | 1 |  Tier 2 fractals should be played in a party with 5. The mechanics hit slightly harder and you encounter mistlock instabilities and <Effect name="Agony"/> | 
| 3    | 106 | 2 |  When starting to do tier 3 fractals you are expected to start reading up on how your class and fractals work. Enemies hit hard, are more frequent and you have to deal with two mistlock instabilities at the same time! |
| 4    | 150 | 3 | When running tier 4 fractals you should be comfortable with your class and the mechanics. It is expected that you carry your own weight. Running with optimal utility and food as well as fractal potions (<Item id="71659" disableText/>, <Item id="76150" disableText/>, <Item id="75427" disableText/>) is expected. |

## Defiance bars 
Have you noticed the blue bar under the boss' HP bar? Whenever you use a Crowd Control skill (a skill that throws the enemy around, stuns or applies movement impaling conditions) a chunk of the bar gets removed. When the entire bar is broken the boss gets the <Effect name="Exposed"/> debuff which increases the incoming damage to the boss by 50%. **This is one of the most important mechanics across all fractals as this allows you to deal huge amounts of damage in a short time.** The idea is to always break this bar and then burst. Ideally everyone in the team contributes to break the bar as it appears. 

<Message>
**Using Crowd Control effectively is the key to success in almost all fractals! A fast break will decrease kill times by a large margin even if your party underperforms in every other aspect!**  
Read more about breaking Defiance bars here: [CC-distribution examples](/guides/cc-distribution)!

## Differences between fractals and raids/strikes
There are quite a few differences that set fractals apart from other PvE content in Guild Wars 2. Most prominently is the length of a single level: One level is usually completed in 5-10 minutes. The levels do not only contain bosses but also other encounters such as small puzzles or fighting mobs. Many levels can be sped up by thinking outside the box and using smart tricks. 

The fractal specific potions influence the way builds are designed. Each of them grants 1.5 times of your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> in a specific stat. This allows builds to be played a lot more offensive compared to elsewhere. Our [builds](/builds) are optimized for multiple amounts of  <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> since you will acquire more than 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> over the course of your fractal journey due to <Augmentation name="Mist Attunement 1"/> and higher augmentations. 

| Potion | Stat | Gain on 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| <Item id="71659"/> | <Attribute name="Precision"/> | 243 <Attribute name="Precision"/> = 11.57% <Attribute name="Critical Chance"/> |
| <Item id="76150"/> | <Attribute name="Toughness"/> | 243 <Attribute name="Toughness"/> |
| <Item id="75427"/> | <Attribute name="Concentration"/> | 243 <Attribute name="Concentration"/> = 16.2% <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> |

## Fractal Masteries
| Name | Points | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Follows Advice | 1 | Unlocks daily rewards for fractals and additional vendors in the fractal lobby. | 
| Agony Channeler | 2 | Allows attuning rings. Fractal potions grant 10% stat bonus (see above). | 
| Recursive Resourcing | 3 | Increases the rewards by a large margin. Fractal potions now grant 25% stat bonus. | 
| Mistlock Singularities | 5 | Unlocks _Mistlock Singularities_. Fractal potions now grant 30% stat bonus. |

## Acquiring gear to counter <Effect name="Agony"/>
For beginners, it is recommended to socket only <Item id="49432"/> in infusion slots of ascended gear since they are the most efficient ones to use and the [builds](/builds) on this website are optimized for having all 18 infusion slots occupied with <Item id="49432"/> to reach 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>. In case you are tight on money you can also slot <Item id="49430"/> and upgrade them later by extracting them with <Item id ="76409"/>.

For a temporary 15 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> buff, you can buy a <Item id="70596"/> and skip ahead of the suggested table below. We suggest acquiring most of the gear in fractals, however, you of course can buy your gear in WvW or open world or any other place.

---

### Tier 1: max 17 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>
Requirement: Full exotic gear  
Optional: Level Chef to 400 (costs about 2.76g, check [gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net/)), craft <Item id="62921" upgrades='49432'/> which enables a fast track to Tier 2 fractals. Since Tier 1 and 2 are essentially identically in difficulty it is recommended to go that route, however, you will need to exchange the backpiece very soon.

Homework: 
- Start working towards the accessories that you can buy with guild commendations or - if you have a lot of spare laurels - buy them for laurels. Keep in mind you need 30 laurels later for crafting your ascended armor.
- Save up relics to buy ascended rings (5 days of T1 fractal dailies are required)
- Alternatively, buy Living World Season 3 Episode 3: A Crack in the ice and farm <Item id="79899"/> for trinkets (or any other living story maps: Bloodstone fen, Dragonfall). The fastest way is to farm both Bitterfrost Frontier and Dragonfall.
- Craft <Item id="77482"/> or buy an aquivalent via laurels (if your build uses base game stats)

---

### Tier 2: max 61 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>
Acquire on your journey in T2: 
- 18 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>: Two ascended accessories of your [build](/builds) of choice. Example: <Item id="39232" upgrades='49432'/> and <Item id="39233" upgrades='49432'/>.
- 36 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>: By attuning ascended rings. Example: <Item id="75187" upgrades='49432,49432'/> and <Item id="74440" upgrades='49432,49432'/>
- 9 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>: Getting a back item such as: <Item id="79830" upgrades="49432"/>

Homework: 
- Start leveling the profession for your armor class (Armorsmith, Leatherwork, Tailor) to 500. Use [gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net) for the cheapest leveling.

---

### Tier 3: max 106 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>
Acquire on your journey in T3: 
- You need 5 more <Item id="49432"/> to fit the maximum requirement of 106 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>. 
- Suggestion: craft 4 ascended armor pieces and hope to get a <Item id="38024"/> to upgrade one of your rings to <Item id="75669" upgrades='49432,49432,49432'/>
- Alternatively, do strike missions and open the weekly chest for a chance of recieving an ascended armor box.

Homework: 
- Start leveling the profession that can craft your desired weapons to 500. Use [gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net) for the cheapest leveling.

---

### Tier 4: max 150 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>
Wrapping up: 
1) Finish your ascended armor
2) Infuse your remaining ring(s)
3) Craft ascended weapons (easy way: [Caladbolg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_weapons) alternatively profession weapons from Path of Fire)
4) Infuse your backpack
5) Upgrade - if necessary - <Item id="49430"/> to <Item id="49432"/>

Congratulations! Now you should have exactly 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> and match the gear in our [builds](/builds) page.

## Current fractal META

Although most groups in LFG don't follow the META it can be beneficial for you to understand how it works in theory to play your own build more efficiently. All the builds in the META have very specific key roles. It is important to fulfill your role to aid the best possible support to your team (also DPS classes support the team with CC and other unique buffs).

Please consult the [meta-page](guides/meta-explained) for more information about the current fractal META.

## Usage of `/gg`

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
You can use the chat command `/gg` within fractals to immediately kill your character (dead, not downed). This can be used generously in fractal skips, as it allows the entire party to teleport to a checkpoint once one player activates it.

If everyone in the party is dead at the same time, cooldowns will reset for all players. Therefore it is advised for the entire group to use `/gg` at certain key positions to reset long cooldowns, like between Siax (2nd boss) and Ensolyss (3rd boss) in Nightmare CM. Never resurrect as long as another player is still alive. If another player tells you `/gg` he is probably doing a skip that you are unaware of or he wasn't ready for combat yet. Either way, do not waste time questioning it.

Note that the <Specialization name="Warrior"/>'s Adrenaline bar, <Specialization name="Druid"/>'s <Skill id="31869"/> and <Skill name="Reapers Shroud"/> for <Specialization name="Reaper"/> will fully recharge after the resurrection. Also the _Mistlock Singularity_ resets once everyone in the party is dead.

## Pre-stacking at Mistlock Singularity

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="12" md="6">
<Video caption="by Rubby" youtube="sMEBz5MJOk8"/>
</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="12" md="6">
After maxing the fractal masteries to level 4 you get access to _Mistlock Singularities_. Taking one of these will reset the cooldowns of all your skills! This allows you to precast certain skills before entering the battle without a penalty. It makes sense to precast <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and use blast finishers on certain Combo Fields. 

The most common applications are <Boon name="Might"/>-stacking using blast finishers inside a _Fire Field_ (3 stacks for 20 seconds with boon duration) and <Effect name="Stealth"/>-stacking inside a _Smoke Field_ (3 seconds).

<Message>
Do not use other combo fields than fire on the _Mistlock Singularity_! All combo fields but the _Fire Field_ are useless in terms of prebooning.
</Message>
</GridItem>
</Grid>
You can find out which skills are _Combo Fields_ and _Combo Finishers_ by hovering over the skill and reading the tooltip. Hover over the following skills: <Skill name="Ring of Fire"/> is a _Fire Field_ and <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> a _Blast Finisher_.  
Below is a list of frequently used blast finishers among all professions. Note that it is often required to swap to different weapons, make sure to swap back before you enter combat.

## Line of Sight (LoS) and stacking

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="12" md="6">
In many Fractals the concept of "Line of Sight" can be applied to pack mobs together without using any skills that <Control name="Pull"/>. As soon as a player takes aggro of a mob it tries to attack the player. In doing so it needs to find a valid path. For enemies with melee weapons this means it will run right towards you, ranged enemies need a clear sight towards the player without obstruction. After taking aggro of a mob the player wants to move behind a wall so the mob loses Line of Sight and is forced to take the shortest path to the player. 

Generally, you **always** want to stick together as a group. Reason being that boons and unique buffs won't reach players that are standing too far away. Since most classes deal high damage in melee the logical conclusion is to stack up, pull mobs together either with <Control name="Pull"/>s or Line of Sight and burst them down as quickly as possible. **Even if the amount of enemies seems dangerous at the first glance the most secure position on the map is in the center of the stack!**

## Mistlock Instabilities

Tier 4 fractals always have three Mistlock Instabilities active which add additional mechanics to the fights. The selection is random for each difficulty level and changes daily. More information can be found [in the official wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists).

Below is a list of all current instabilities and their possible countermeasures.

| | |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Instability name="Adrenaline Rush"/>  | When enraged, enemies deal 150% increased damage while they're low on health. Enemies deal 20% less damage when not enraged.     |
| <Instability name="Afflicted"/>   | Outgoing <Boon name="Resistance"/> duration is increased by 50%. Enemies apply random conditions. (<Condition name="Bleeding"/>, <Condition name="Burning"/>, <Condition name="Confusion"/>, <Condition name="Poisoned"/> and <Condition name="Torment"/>). Not necessary, although a good countermeasure is to have the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> use <Skill id="45460"/> or blasting light fields.  |
| <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/>           |  This means that players in combat are randomly marked with Flux Bombs which leave a damaging and blinding AoE field behind. Do not place those inside the combat area, learn to dash away right before the field deploys. If you keep walking forward while marked you won't get any damage from the bomb. Flux bombs now apply to both allies and enemies. ***It is a little DPS increase to deploy it under the boss/mobs but it is not worth it blinding your team members!***                                    |
| <Instability name="Last Laugh"/>          | Enemies explode upon death if not stunned. Stunned enemies apply protection and stability to nearby players. Each enemy killed explodes within a 180 radius 1.75 seconds after its death, dealing high damage and apply <Control name="Daze"/> to foes around it. Recognizable by a yellow zone after a mob's death. Stunned enemies apply <Boon name="Protection"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> to nearby players.                                                                                                                               |
| <Instability name="Mists Convergence"/>   | Causes a set of effects from other fractals to spawn, including _The Mossman_, a deadly _Champion Rabbit_, _Veteran Jade Maw Tentacles_, an _airstrike_ from the PvP map Skyhammer and the _cannon assault_ from Captain Mai Trin Fractal.                                                                                           |
| <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>    | Enemies receive <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> when you hit them. Has a 20 second internal cooldown per enemy rank, <Specialization name="Renegade"/> can strip with <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> (<Skill name="Legendary Demon stance"/>) or <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> can strip with <Skill name="Well of Corruption"/> and weapon skills or <Skill name="Throw mine"/> from <Specialization name="Holosmith"/> or <Specialization name="Chronomancer"/> can strip with <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> or auto-attacks. Stripping an enemy boon will steal their life.   |
| <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/>  | Players will be pushed away from one another. Make sure to not run around like a headless chicken! Find a good spot and stand still. |
| <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/>         | Enemies leave a trail of poison behind them which inflicts direct damage and the <Condition name="Poisoned"/> condition. Blocking a toxic-trail attack will absorb it and cleanse the condition. It can be very dangerous when fighting multiple mobs. Removes <Boon name="Aegis"/>.  |
| <Instability name="Fractal Vindicators"/> | Fractal Avengers are replaced by hard-hitting Fractal Vindicators. Those need to be killed as fast as possible to prevent further chaos.     |
| <Instability name="Hamstrung"/>   | The lower your health, the slower you move. Endurance regenerates 33% faster. Heal yourself to reduce Hamstrung stacks!      |
| <Instability name="Boon Overload"/> | Each boon on a player increases incoming strike damage by 5%. Outgoing boon duration is increased by 20%.    |
| <Instability name="Frailty"/> | Players are smaller and have 30% less health, but they move 25% faster.     |
| <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> | Enemies create flaming missiles when damaged. Incoming condition damage is reduced by 20%. It can be reflected for extra damage. In T4s <Specialization name="Renegade"/> should bring <Skill name="Legendary Centaur stance"/> and keep the bubble up in critical moments.    |
| <Instability name="Vengeance"/> | When enemies die, they enhance nearby foes with multiple boons, it does not apply to elite foes. Strip any enemy boon to inflict them with weakness.     |
| <Instability name="Outflanked"/> | Foes within 300 range do 300% more damage when attacking from behind, but do 25% less damage to you (their damage is reduced to 75%) when attacking from ahead.  |
| <Instability name="Stick Together"/> |   Take 60% increased damage when not within a range of 300 of an ally. Take 20% reduced damage when within a range of 300 of an ally.    |
| <Instability name="Sugar Rush"/> | Increases player movement speed and attack speed by 15%. Elite and lower enemies' movement speed and attack speed increases by 35%.      |
| <Instability name="Toxic Sickness"/> | Players are occasionally affected by the toxic vomit attack out of the Nightmare Fractal. Every player gets a cone AoE in front of him, aiming at a party member will deal lethal damage. Proper stacking and positioning nullify this instability effectively.      |

## Key findings
- Don't use your heal skill while under the effect of <Effect name="Agony"/>.
- CC the boss first, then use your burst skills. **Everyone has to contribute!**
- Only use _Fire Fields_ on the _Mistlock Singularity_ during pre-stacking.
- Always stack together, boons are shared in close proximity.
- Don't be afraid to communicate with your team if you are new.

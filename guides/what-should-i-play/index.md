This page introduces all the builds on this website by giving a very short overview over the gameplay. It may help you to choose the right class for your very own playstyle. Generally there are three types of builds: DPS, offensive support and defensive support builds. A META team for example is only running DPS and offensive support builds.

Outline:
1. **META:** These builds perform best in a group. [Click here](/guides/meta-explained) to find more out about how and why the current fractal META works well. The META is designed to provide the fastest clear across all fractals.
2. **Condi META:** These builds will perfom best in 100CM, but will fall off in faster groups on other encounters [Click here](/guides/meta-explained) to find more out about how and why the current fractal META works well.
3. **OFFMETA:** Builds in this category can substitute builds of the META category, but will provide worse performance in an optimal scenario.

<Card specialization="Soulbeast">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Soulbeast" disableLink />](/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 

<Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills. Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv). The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

This build is rather self sufficient due to:
- <Boon name="Quickness"/> from <Trait name="livefast"/> 
- <Boon name="Might"/> from <Trait name="Huntersgaze"/>
- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/> 
- High CC with <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> and <Skill name="pathofscars"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="monarchsleap"/>, <Skill id="45743"/> and <Skill id="12521"/>

Overall this is a very well rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

<Card specialization="Renegade">

| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery |

| [<Specialization name="Renegade" disableLink />](/builds/revenant/power-renegade) | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | 
<Specialization name="Renegade"/> is the profession with the most support and utility among all META classes. It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>, a unique buff over 150 <Attribute name="Ferocity"/> with <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/>, an insanely strong party heal and additional damage with <Skill name="soulcleavessummit"/>, and if that is not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>. 

Damage wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other META classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter: in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS player sweaty. 

Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from  <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card specialization="Firebrand">

| [<Specialization name="Firebrand" disableLink />](/builds/revenant/power-renegade) | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The **<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** (also **_Quickness Firebrand_** or **_Quickbrand_**) provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> to the party while dealing decent DPS.

It plays very similar to <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> with the addition of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> mantras and tomes. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls.

Using <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars also increases your allies' <Attribute name="Power"/> by 216 for 10 seconds thanks to <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.

<Message>
Its worth to mention that *<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>* is exceedingly strong when bosses phase quickly. For various T4 fractals, long fights or if you happen to be in a slower group (most PuG groups), you want to run *<BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/>* as it provides much higher sustained DPS.

<Card specialization="Dragonhunter" title="Power Dragonhunter">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery |

| [<Specialization name="Dragonhunter" disableLink />](/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter) | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> was moved to the [offmeta](/builds/) due to the fact that you can not replace a <Specialization name="Weaver"/> or <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>. <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> is a meta build only if it replaces <Specialization name="Firebrand" /> and being the main source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> by taking <Skill name="feelmywrath"/>, which is used only in short encounters in higher end groups. 

<Specialization name="Dragonhunter" /> is good and easy to play build for fractals. It has great burst options and deals high consistent damage while providing medium defiance bar damage and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.

The build offers a unique party wide offensive buff by sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> for 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> and also strong on-demand defensive support with <Skill id="30039"/> and other useful skills such as <Skill id="9251"/>, <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

Compared to other builds the <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> is rather self-sufficient thanks to blocks from <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/>, <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and a very strong heal skill (<Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>) that makes the player invincible for 6 seconds.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Divider text="Condi Meta builds"/>

<Card specialization="Firebrand" title="Condi Firebrand">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Firebrand" disableLink />](/builds/guardian/condi-firebrand) | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | 

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> to the party while dealing high consistent DPS. In organized teams this build is inferior to <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Power Firebrand"/> because it takes too much time to ramp up the damage. For slower groups however you can achieve very competitive results making DPS players sweat. Your tomes are by far your most important skills, they enable you to do great DPS as well as support and heal your allies. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls. 

This build has tremendous amounts of self-sustain and is therfore also a great build for soloing content:
- Permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>.
- Permanent 25x Might if you swap to <Trait name="zealous scepter"/>.
- <Skill id="41780"/> for heals.
- <Skill id="42259"/> for <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and damage reduction.
- Optionally: <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for a 6s long high HP regeneration.
 
One main downside of <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> is that you lack CC (Crowd Control), and missing the unique party wide +216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff provided by <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>. 

Overall this build is one of the best picks for newer players, for PuGs as <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider or for people that want to be more independant of their groups.

<Card specialization="Renegade" title="Condi Alac Renegade">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Renegade" disableLink />](/builds/revenant/condi-alac-renegade) | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | 

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a unique role that you will want to play on [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) only, as <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> is better in any other fractals. Though, Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very decent damage output and can be pretty efficient when played properly. Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> provides <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and some <Boon name="Might"/> through <Skill id="45537"/> and <Skill id="44076"/> respectively, <Skill id="45773"/> that can help your party sustain to  high pressure situations, and to top it off, very good cc skills like <Skill id="41220"/>, <Skill id="28409"/> and <Skill id="41820"/>.

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is pretty independent due to its rather good mobility (<Skill id="27964"/>, <Skill id="28029"/>, <Skill id="27917"/>) and its permanent 25 <Boon name="Might"/> thanks to <Skill id="44076"/> and <Trait id="1781"/>.

Even if Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> does less damage than a <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> or a <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/>, it is still the better pick over <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> on [Sunqua Peak CM](/fractals/sunqua-peak), especially on Dark Phase (Second Phase). In most cases a party wants to keep a <Specialization name="Renegade"/> as source for <Boon name="Alacrity"/>.

</Card>

<Card specialization="Soulbeast" title="Condi Soulbeast">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Soulbeast" disableLink />](/builds/ranger/condi-soulbeast) | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | 

Condi <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with high sustained damage and reasonable burst that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, and crowd control (CC) skills. This build is mostly used for 100CM, for most other fractals you will be better off playing the power variant found [here](/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast/).


This build is rather self sufficient due to:
- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/> 
- Good CC with <Skill id="46432"/> and <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="Instinctive Engage"/> and <Skill name="Quick Shot"/>

Overall this is a very well rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

<Card specialization="Deadeye" title="Condi Deadeye">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Deadeye" disableLink />](builds/thief/condi-deadeye) | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** is quite a selfish build, that will not provide your party with any form of support. Instead, the value of this build comes almost entirely from the pure damage that it will bring, which is inflated by the **<Specialization text="Condi Soulbeast" name="Soulbeast"/>**'s <Skill id="40498"/>, on top of Venom Skills which can be precasted on the _Mistlock Sanctuary_, and casted again as soon as your allies have consummed them by attacking the target. Consequently, the **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** is able to apply a tremendous amount of <Condition name="Poisoned"/> and <Condition name="Bleeding"/> instances, as well as an unneglectable amount of <Condition name="Torment"/>. As such, it is necessary to be running with a <Item id="44944"/> as it will become very valuable in bursting phases. Lastly, <Skill id="13132"/> can bring up to 750 Defiance Bar damage, if used at the proper moment, meaning if all instances of this ability are consummed when the boss is vulnerable to this type of damage (up to ten stacks, two per player). 

This build possesses a decent amount of self-sustain, due to <Trait id="2111"/>, but it suffers greatly from a <Boon name="Quickness"/> deficit. However, it doesn't suffer too much from a lack of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> due to the nature of _Initiative_. 


Overall, this build is an excellent pick if taken as an alt class: it is meant for players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward rotations. Played correctly, it is excellent in PuGs on single-target bosses such as the ones from Challenge Mode Fractals, most notably Sorrowful Spellcaster (Light and Dark Ai) and Ensolyss, or any boss with little to no phases. We do not recommand running this build in 99CM, as positioning is most important there, and jumping <Skill name="shadowstrike"/> becomes terrible due to Cosmic Energy (low gravity). Details for this build can be found at the bottom of the page.

<Card specialization="Weaver">

| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Weaver" disableLink />](/builds/elementalist/power-weaver) | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Sword Weaver"/> is currently one of the strongest DPS builds for fractals. <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Sword Weaver"/> provides conjures, <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, and additional <Boon name="Might"/> through placing fire fields and blasting them. Also it is very useful for some t4 skips like Aetherblade, Cliffside, Thaumanova Reactor etc. thanks to high mobility and <Skill id="5536"/>.

Unfortunately this build is pretty squishy and besides the healing skill does not have any defensive abilities to mitigate damage or cleanse conditions, so high awareness is required. Special care needs to be taken on fractals with <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/>. 

Also this build depends pretty much on supports and boon uptimes, as it can't provide any boons itself besides some <Boon name="Might"/> by blasting fire fields. This build has one of the most fluid rotations in game which makes it enjoyable to play if given some dedication. The build benefits heavily from slaying potions and sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card specialization="Berserker">

| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery |

| [<Specialization name="Berserker" disableLink />](/builds/warrior/power-berserker) | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is the strongest build for <Specialization name="Warrior"/> in fractals.

Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs through the stats of <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> and having excellent defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has medium burst and excellent sustained damage. <Specialization name="Warrior"/> can provide half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> to the group by using <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>.

The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is one of the classes that benefit a lot from higher agony resistance due to not being able to crit cap by buffs and traits alone.

Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>. As a <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> your focus is to maintain your unique party buffs and instantly contribute to breaking defiance bars, all while making DPS players sweat nervously when they glance at their DPS meter.

| [<Specialization name="Holosmith" disableLink />](/builds/engineer/power-holosmith) | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The engineer build that currently fares best in fractals is the <Specialization text="Power Holosmith" name="Holosmith"/>, offering a mix of high damage and a relatively good amount of crowd control and utility in form of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and some <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Crippled"/> and <Condition name="Immobile"/>.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.
</Card>

<Card specialization="Reaper" title="Power Reaper">

| [<Specialization name="Reaper" disableLink />](/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) | <Rating value="1"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | 
The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

<Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> has multiple offensive skill options (<Control name="Pull"/>, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>, <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Immobile"/>, etc.) <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card specialization="Chronomancer" title="Power Chronomancer">

The <Specialization text="Power Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> is the strongest (and only) build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals. Despite having one of the highest benchmarks in the game, this build is not that great in fractals due to long rampup times which make it strong for PuGs and a suboptimal pick for faster groups. If necessary the build can bring its own <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> making it rather self sufficient. 

To succeed as a <Specialization text="Power Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in higher-end groups you'll need to be able to __adapt__ your rotation on the go and push the limits of your class, but even then you will probably be a hinderance for your group.

You'll provide boon removal through your clones, auto-attack chains, <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/>.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized.

This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

<Card specialization="Scourge" title="Condi Scourge">

| [<Specialization name="Scourge" disableLink />](/builds/necromancer/condi-scourge) | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | 

The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge"/> is an easy to learn build that provides access to good off-support tools, can be augmented to provide the means to provide a safety net at an acceptable dps loss with the Blood Magic traitline (without any stat changes), and can place conditions/cc on multiple targets simultaneously with its shades and <Skill name="Epidemic">. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> in combination with its other tools it can help

<Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge"/> has multiple offensive control skill options: (<Control name="Pull"/>, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>, <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Immobile"/>, etc.) <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge"/> and can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

This build also does not have a formal rotation, and instead has a prioritization for its skills making it easy to focus on side objectives and quickly pick up where you left off in dealing damage.

Due to being a condition based build, it will not benefit as highly from slaying potions or <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as much as power builds.

</Card>

<Card specialization="Weaver" title="Condi Weaver">

| [<Specialization name="Weaver" disableLink />](/builds/elementalist/condi-weaver) | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | 

The **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** is an unique build that can be played very effectively in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak), and will almost always outperform <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> (if you find yourself in a slow group, this build can also be an attractive choice for ''slower'' encounters like Ensolyss and Arkk).

Condi <Specialization name="Weaver"/> can deal very high amounts of damage, and even rival [META](/guides/meta-explained) builds like <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/> and <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> when played properly.

This build is naturally tanky due to its rotation, having easy access to skills that provide evasion frames with <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, barrier with <Skill name="Lava Skin"/>, condition cleansing with <Skill name="Magnetic Wave"/> and even <Skill name="Obsidian Flesh"/>, a powerful skill that grants <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> against most attacks. It can also bring some group utility in the form of projectile destruction with <Skill name="Swirling Winds"/>.
 
The main downside of **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** apart from the complexity of its rotation is the lack of unique party buffs and overall boon generation, apart from some <Boon name="Might"/> granted by placing fire fields and randomly blasting them.

<Message>
This build is very common in PuGs. It is part of a composition called PuG meta, you can read more about it [here](/guides/meta-explained). We **recommend** to play [Heal Renegade](/builds/revenant/heal-renegade) for statics who are starting out and know the mechanics (after around 9000-15000+ <Item id="94020"/>). This recommendation is because  <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> can deal way more damage than <Specialization name="Renegade"/> (Leading to higher group DPS). However if you fail mechanics <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> is a way to success.
</Message>

It provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/> and a decent amount of might. Exactly like the meta-counterpart it provides good offensive support via <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>, it is important to understand that the signet share is essential to faster runs and sharing extra power during <Effect name="Exposed"/> (broken Defiance bar). The main source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> is <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/> and <Skill name="Potent Haste"/>; <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> is optional.

The <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> heals with any symbols, dodges, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/>, and if necessary <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/>. If your group is unable to stay alive, you can swap out your offensive support (<Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and radiance) to virtues for more heals, *but* it should not be needed.

When <Instability name="Afflicted"/> is present or enemies are applying conditions, you can use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> (Staff3) and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> (Staff2) for area condition cleanse.


If you play this build we highly recommend learning the <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> share variant. If you want a good and smooth run, take a look at the [Fractal Pages](/fractals). This class will not be doing much damage but understanding how the class works best and when to do <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> sharing is important!

description: If you do not know what class you want to play.

This page introduces all the builds on this website by giving a very short overview over the gameplay. It may help you to choose the right class for your very own playstyle. Generally there are three types of builds: DPS, offensive support and defensive support builds. A META team for example is only running DPS and offensive support builds.

Outline:

1. **Condi:** These builds utilize condition damage as their main damage source. Due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> now granting 100% increased <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> these builds perform well in daily clears. [Click here](/guides/meta-explained) to find out more about how and why these builds are played. These builds are not ranked but sorted alphabetically; please check the overview of each build to see if it is right for you.
2. **Power:** These builds utilize power damage as their main damage source. These builds perform well in daily clears, but require more coordination to play, and also in more organised groups looking to push for faster kill times. [Click here](/guides/meta-explained) to find out more about how and why these builds are played. These builds are not ranked but sorted alphabetically; please check the overview of each build to see if it is right for you.
3. **Hybrid:** It is not possible to unambiguously assign a hybrid build to any of the other categories. For example a hybrid build might be dealing damage while also providing more party support, which is especially strong in PuG groups. It could also have a rather mixed damage distribution (power vs. condition damage). [Click here](/guides/meta-explained) to find out more about how and why these builds are played. These builds are not ranked but sorted alphabetically; please check the overview of each build to see if it is right for you.
4. **Heal:** These builds are full support builds. Due to the current META these builds are less effective due to the general tankiness and support most builds can bring, but are a great option for newer groups who would like more of a safety net to complete their fractals. [Click here](/guides/meta-explained) to find out more about how and why these builds are played. These builds are not ranked but sorted alphabetically; please check the overview of each build to see if it is right for you.

<Card specialization="Renegade" title="Condi (Alac) Renegade">

| Build                                                              | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |

| <BuildLink build="Condi Alac Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> |

<Warning>

This build is mainly to be used in condition comps. In power comps <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> is strictly better due to a lot of factors such as quick burst, more support and being more versatile.

</Warning>

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is an unique build that may only be played in condition comps, since it performs much better than <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/>. Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has decent damage output and can be pretty efficient when played properly. Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> provides <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and some <Boon name="Might"/> through <Skill id="45537"/> and <Skill id="44076"/> respectively. Finally, to top it off this build has high CC capabilities with <Skill id="41220"/>, <Skill id="28409"/> and <Skill id="41820"/>.

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is pretty independent due to its rather good mobility (<Skill id="28029"/>, <Skill id="27917"/>) and permanent 25 <Boon name="Might"/> thanks to <Skill id="44076"/> and <Trait id="1781"/>.

<Card specialization="Firebrand" title="Condi (Quick) Firebrand">

| Build                                                           | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> |

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** can provide permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> (if necessary) to the party while dealing high consistent DPS. Your tomes are by far your most important skills, they enable you to do great DPS as well as support and heal your allies. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls.

This build has tremendous amounts of self-sustain and is therefore also a great build for soloing content:

- Permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>.
- Some <Boon name="Might"/> uptime.
- <Skill id="41780"/> for heals.
- <Skill id="42259"/> for <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and damage reduction.
- Optionally: <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for a 6s long high HP regeneration.

Overall this build is one of the best picks for newer players, for PuGs as <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider or for people that want to be more independent of their groups.

<Card specialization="Harbinger" title="Condi (Quick) Harbinger">

| Build                                                           | Synergy             | DPS                | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Harbinger" specialization="Harbinger"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> |

The <Specialization name="Harbinger" text="Condi Harbinger"/> provides high Condition damage while having some self-generated boons due to Elixirs as well as some group <Boon name="Might"/> through <Skill name="Blood is Power"/>. You can also adapt your build to provide <Boon name="Quickness"/> as well as share your Elixir boons with your group. You can also upkep 25 stacks of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on your own after the initial ramp-up.

The <Specialization name="Harbinger" text="Condi Harbinger"/> is more squishy than other <Specialization name="Necromancer"/> builds because it loses maximum health due to the <Effect name="Blight"/> mechanic and <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/> does not act as a second health bar. However, even with maximum <Effect name="Blight"/> stacks, you will still be at around 15k health.

</Card>

<Card specialization="Deadeye" title="Condi Deadeye">

| Build                                                       | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Deadeye" specialization="Deadeye"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> |

The **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** is quite a selfish build, that will not provide your party with any form of support. Instead, the value of this build comes almost entirely from the pure damage that it will bring, which is inflated by the **<Specialization text="Condi Soulbeast" name="Soulbeast"/>**'s <Skill id="40498"/>, on top of Venom Skills which can be precast on the _Mistlock Singularity_, and casted again as soon as your allies have consumed them by attacking the target. Consequently, the **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** is able to apply a tremendous amount of <Condition name="Poisoned"/> and <Condition name="Bleeding"/> instances, as well as an non-negligible amount of <Condition name="Torment"/>. As such, it is necessary to be running with a <Item id="44944"/> as it will become very valuable in bursting phases. Lastly, <Skill id="13132"/> can bring up to 750 Defiance Bar damage, if used at the proper moment, meaning if all instances of this ability are consumed when the boss is vulnerable to this type of damage (up to five stacks, one per player).

This build possesses a decent amount of self-sustain, due to <Trait id="2111"/>, but it will suffer greatly from a <Boon name="Quickness"/> deficit. However, it won't suffer too much from a lack of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> due to the nature of _Initiative_.

Overall, this build is an excellent pick if taken as an alt class: it is meant for players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward rotations. Played correctly, it is excellent in PuGs on single-target bosses such as the ones from Challenge Mode Fractals, most notably Sorrowful Spellcaster (Light Ai) and Ensolyss, or any boss with little to no phases, as well as multiple add phases, such as the ones from Shattered Observatory.
A playlist of videos showcasing the **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** and the **<Specialization text="Condi Daredevil" name="Daredevil"/>** can be found on [Magic's channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC8zIP7qMiNPQAHWjt_V_B_EtGaJaGJaM). It is currently incomplete, but you will find benchmarks, CM boss kills, and some T4 gameplay in organized groups.

We do not recommend running these builds in Shattered Observatory for new players or beginners, as positioning is most important there, and jumping <Skill name="shadowstrike"/> becomes an issue due to Cosmic Energy (low gravity). Extensive details for the build can be found at the bottom of the page.

<Card specialization="Scourge" title="Condi Scourge">

| Build                                                       | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Scourge" specialization="Scourge"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> |

The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge"/> is an easy build to learn and provides access to good off-support tools (large amounts of passive barrier from <Trait id="2059"/>) and can be augmented to provide the means of a safety net at an acceptable amount of DPS loss with the Blood Magic traitline (without any stat changes). The build can place lots of conditions and crowd control on multiple targets simultaneously with its shades and <Skill name="Epidemic"/>. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> in combination with its other tools, it is quite self-substantial.

The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge" /> has multiple offensive control
skill options, like using <Control name="Pull" />, corrupt boons for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, cause conditions like <Condition name="Blinded" /> and <Condition name="Immobile" />
, etc. <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge" /> and can modify
itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

This build also does not have a formal rotation, and instead has a prioritization for its skills making it easy to focus on side objectives and quickly pick up where you left off in dealing damage.

<Card specialization="Soulbeast" title="Condi Soulbeast">

| Build                                                           | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> |

Condi <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with high sustained damage and reasonable burst that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, and crowd control (CC) skills. This build is mostly used for 100CM, for most other fractals you will be better off playing the power variant found [here](/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast/).

This build is rather self sufficient due to:

- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/>
- Good CC with <Skill id="46432"/> and <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="Instinctive Engage"/> and <Skill name="Quick Shot"/>

Overall this is a very well rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

</Card>

<Card specialization="Specter" title="Condi Specter">

| Build                                                           | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> |

The **<Specialization text="Condi Specter" name="Specter"/>** is a high DPS condition build with great team support options. The value of this build comes from the pure damage that it will bring, which is inflated by the **<Specialization text="Condi Soulbeast" name="Soulbeast"/>**'s <Skill id="40498"/>, on top of Venom Skills which can be precast on the _Mistlock Singularity_, and casted again as soon as your allies have consumed them by attacking the target.

At the same time it can generate large amounts of <Effect name="Barrier"/> for your party, some healing and a small amount of <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/> by targeting allied players.

</Card>

<Card specialization="Virtuoso" title="Condi Virtuoso">

| Build                                                     | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Virtuoso" specialization="Virtuoso"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="1"/> | <Rating value="3"/> |

The <Specialization text="Condi Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is a strong condition-based build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals, mainly focusing on <Condition name="Bleeding"/>.

It offers great sustained DPS with a very simple rotation. On top of that it also has a high range and great sustain due to <Trait name="Jagged Mind"/>. At the same time it is quite an independant class with great boon generation, being able to upkeep a good amount of self <Boon name="fury"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> and if traited <Boon name="Quickness"/> from traits in the Dueling and Illusions traitlines. On top of this <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> also cna help provide a significant amount of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> from <Skill name="Phantasmal Warden"/>.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/>also provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized.

</Card>

<Card specialization="Weaver" title="Condi Weaver">

| Build                                                     | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="5"/> |

The **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** is an unique build that can be played very effectively in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak), and will almost always outperform <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> (if you find yourself in a slow group, this build can also be an attractive choice for ''slower'' encounters like Ensolyss and Arkk).

Condi <Specialization name="Weaver"/> can deal very high amounts of damage, and even rival [META](/guides/meta-explained) builds like <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/> and <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> when played properly.

This build is naturally tanky due to its rotation, having easy access to skills that provide evasion frames with <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, barrier with <Skill name="Lava Skin"/>, condition cleansing with <Skill name="Magnetic Wave"/> and even <Skill name="Obsidian Flesh"/>, a powerful skill that grants <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> against most attacks. It can also bring some group utility in the form of projectile destruction with <Skill name="Swirling Winds"/>.

The main downside of **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** apart from the complexity of its rotation is the lack of unique party buffs and overall boon generation, apart from some <Boon name="Might"/> granted by placing fire fields and randomly blasting them.

</Card>

<Card specialization="Willbender" title="Condi Willbender">

| Build                                                     | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Condi Willbender" specialization="Willbender"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> |

The <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Condition Willbender"/> is a strong build for guardian. It has high damage, CC and mobility making it a strong choice for all groups. It also can easily slot more supportive utility skills allowing you to provide yourself and your party with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and reflects.

There are many different gear variations that can be run on this build that vary damage wise in certain situations. Overall when considering <Effect name="Exposed"/> and the fact you can share gear with <Specialization name="Firebrand" text ="Condi Firebrand"/> makes the setup below the best option for fractals. If you want to optimize for different situations you can use our [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/).

This build also makes use of a <Item id="96613"/> gaining <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> from <Trait name="Power of the Virtuous"/>. Removing this does not change the gear!

If you need to swap a utility out, <Skill name="Signet of Wrath"/> is a minor dps increase and should be swapped out when other skills suit the encounter better.
You will want the following weapons to swap to durning fractal runs:

- Greatsword for pulling adds in Nightmare CM after MAMA and some T4s
- A staff for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking.
- Greatsword can also be run as an alternative to Sword offering extra cleave and a useful leap

<Card specialization="Berserker" title="Banner Baerserker">

| Build                                                           | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |

| <BuildLink build="Power Berserker" specialization="Berserker"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> |

The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is the strongest build for <Specialization name="Warrior"/> in fractals.

Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs through the stats of <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> and having excellent defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has medium burst and excellent sustained damage. <Specialization name="Warrior"/> can provide half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> to the group by using <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>.

The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is one of the classes that benefit a lot from higher agony resistance due to not being able to crit cap by buffs and traits alone.

Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>. As a <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> your focus is to maintain your unique party buffs and instantly contribute to breaking defiance bars, all while making DPS players sweat nervously when they glance at their DPS meter.

<Card specialization="Bladesworn" title="Banner Bladesworn">

| Build                                                           | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |

| <BuildLink build="Power Bladesworn" specialization="Bladesworn"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> |

The <Specialization text="Power Bladesworn" name="Bladesworn"/> is a situationally strong build for <Specialization name="Warrior"/> in fractals. It has more initial burst than <Specialization text="Power Berserker" name="Berserker"/> thanks to <Skill name="Dragon Trigger" />, but loses most of its sustained damage in favour of short damage spikes. Unfortunately if enemies dont phase or die shortly after your burst, your damage drops off hard and you would be better playing <Specialization text="Power Berserker" name="Berserker"/>.

Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs through the stats of <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/>. <Specialization name="Warrior"/> can provide half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> to the group by using <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>.

The <Specialization text="Power Bladesworn" name="Bladesworn"/> is one of the classes that benefit a lot from higher agony resistance due to not being able to crit cap by buffs and traits alone. Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

<Card specialization="Firebrand" title="Power (Quick) Firebrand">

| Build                                                           | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |

| <BuildLink build="Power Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> |

The **<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** (also **_Quickness Firebrand_** or **_Quickbrand_**) provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> to the party while dealing good DPS.

It plays very similar to <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> and <BuildLink build="Power Willbender" specialization="Willbender"/> with the addition of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> mantras and tomes. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls.

Using <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars also increases your allies' <Attribute name="Power"/> by 216 for 10 seconds thanks to <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.

<Warning>

Its worth mentioning that <Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> is exceedingly strong when bosses phase quickly. For various T4 fractals, long fights or if you happen to be in a slower group (most PuG groups), you want to run <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> as it provides much higher sustained DPS.

<Card specialization="Renegade" title="Power (Alac) Renegade">

| Build                                                         | Synergy             | DPS                 | Independence        | Basics              | Mastery             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> |

The <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is the profession with the most support and utility among all META classes. It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>, a unique buff over 150 <Attribute name="Ferocity"/> with <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/> and if that is not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>.

Damage-wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other META classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter; in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS players sweaty.

Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> is good and easy to play build for fractals. It has great burst options and deals high consistent damage while providing medium defiance bar damage and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>. The build offers a unique party wide offensive buff by sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> for 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> and also strong on-demand defensive support with <Skill id="30039"/> and other useful skills such as <Skill id="9251"/> and <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

<Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> is rather self-sufficient thanks to blocks from <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/>, <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and a very strong heal skill (<Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>) that makes the player invincible for 6 seconds. It also benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

The <Specialization text="Power Holosmith" name="Holosmith"/> is a flexible build that can do well in a variety of different group compositions.
It offers:

- High burst and good sustained damage
- Good crowd control
- Good utility through <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and access to some <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Crippled"/> and <Condition name="Immobile"/>
- The ability to boonstrip with <Skill name="Detonate Mine Field"/> when running <Skill name="Throw Mine"/>
- An incredible skill set for various skips in Tier 4 fractals due to access to <Effect name="Stealth"/>, as well as <Effect name="Superspeed"/> and a targeted leap with <Skill name="Jump Shot"/>
- Some **self**-generation of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/>

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of slaying scarlets armies"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

The main thing the build lacks compared to other Power DPS classes is a unique party buff for Power compositions like <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/>'s <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> share.

There are 3 different versions of <Specialization text="Power Holosmith" name="Holosmith"/>, namely Sword ECSU, Sword PBM and Rifle PBM. They are named after:

- The weapon they are holding, Sword+Shield vs Rifle.
- The Grandmaster Holosmith Trait they use, Enhanced Capacity Storage Unit (ECSU) vs Photonic Blasting Module (PBM).

The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> has multiple offensive skill
options (<Control name="Pull" />, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, <Condition name="Blinded" />, <Condition name="Immobile" />, etc.) <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

| <BuildLink build="Power Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> |

The <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills. Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv). The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

This build is rather self sufficient due to:

- <Boon name="Quickness"/> from <Trait name="livefast"/>
- <Boon name="Might"/> from <Trait name="Huntersgaze"/>
- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/>
- High CC with <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> and <Skill name="pathofscars"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="monarchsleap"/>, <Skill id="45743"/> and <Skill id="12521"/>

Overall this is a very well rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

The <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is the strongest power build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals.

You'll provide boon removal through <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/> as well as Sword auto-attack chains when playing the Focus/Pistol variant.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized. This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

The <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Sword Weaver"/> is currently one of the strongest DPS builds for fractals. <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Sword Weaver"/> provides conjures, <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, and additional <Boon name="Might"/> through placing fire fields and blasting them. Also it is very useful for some t4 skips like Aetherblade, Cliffside, Thaumanova Reactor etc. thanks to high mobility and <Skill id="5536"/>.

Unfortunately this build is pretty squishy and besides the healing skill does not have any defensive abilities to mitigate damage or cleanse conditions, so high awareness is required. Special care needs to be taken on fractals with <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/>.

Also this build depends pretty much on supports and boon uptimes, as it can't provide any boons itself besides some <Boon name="Might"/> by blasting fire fields. This build has one of the most fluid rotations in game which makes it enjoyable to play if given some dedication. The build benefits heavily from slaying potions and sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

The **<Specialization text="Celestial Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is a build for groups to use instead of a **<Specialization text="Heal Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>**. It provides more than enough healing for most groups, permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, a large chunk (15-18 stacks) of <Boon name="might"/> and on demand <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/>, whilst dealing a decent amount of damage. It is especially strong in PuGs where often a **<Specialization text="Heal Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is overkill, especially in condi groups, but the convenience of having a more supportive player pumping out important boons such as <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and heals is invaluable.

It plays very similar to <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/>, except that the damage output is significantly lowered due to slotting the Honor trait line.

The general idea of these builds is to leverage the Celestial stat combo (<Attribute name="Power"/>, <Attribute name="Precision"/>, <Attribute name="Toughness"/>, <Attribute name="Vitality"/>, <Attribute name="Ferocity"/>,<br/> <Attribute name="Healing Power"/>, <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/>, <Attribute name="Concentration"/>, <Attribute name="Expertise"/>) and the Seraph stat combo (<Attribute name="Precision"/>, <Attribute name="Healing Power"/>, <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> and <Attribute name="Concentration"/>). This gives a high amount of <Attribute name="Healing Power"/> and <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/>. They then uses Runes, Sigils and Food to cap <Condition name="Burning"/> duration allowing you to deal a good amount of damage.

There are Four variants on the site; a low AR Celestial variant, a high AR Celestial variant, a high AR Seraph variant, and a Celestial Heal variant. The Celestial 162 variant is the standard version with high boon duration and provides solid damage while being fairly forgiving with boon uptimes. It also has the advantage of wroking well in other content outside of fractals with minimal changes. The high AR Celestial and Seraph variants are more offensive build and offer the most damage. Both builds pull similar damage with the Seraph version being slightly ahead due to having higher <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> and <Effect name="Exposed"/>. While the Celestial Heal variant is much more supportive and a last resort before swapping to <BuildLink build="Heal Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> . All of these builds can be optimised further with a mix of gear to suit your needs using our [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/).

<Warning>

This build is very common in PuGs. It is part of a composition called PuG Meta. More info about this composition can be found [here](/guides/meta-explained). This build provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing. It therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities.

</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Alacrity Mechanist" /> provides permanent <Boon name="Might" />, <Boon name="Alacrity" />, <Boon name="Fury" />, <Boon name="Regeneration" /> and <Boon name="Vigor" />, as well as some <Boon name="Protection" />. It also has access to a small amount of <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability" /> througt <Skill id="63293"/>.

It offers a large of healing thanks to <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, <Skill name="Super Elixir"/>, permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Vigor"/> that you get from <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>. Whenever you use a Jade Golem skill it pumps out more healing when traited with <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/>. You can also provide a huge amount of <Effect name="barrier"/> with <Skill id="63141"/>, <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/> and <Skill name="Barrier Blast"/> maintaing a near permanant uptime on your party.

<Warning>

This build is very common in PuGs. It is part of a composition called PuG Meta. More info about this composition can be found [here](/guides/meta-explained). This build provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing. It therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. Once the safety of a dedicated healer is no longer needed, you can move on to running [Power Firebrand](/builds/guardian/power-firebrand) or [Condi Firebrand](/builds/guardian/condi-firebrand). We also added a hybrid variant that is in-between the full heal and damage versions called [Celestial Firebrand](/builds/guardian/celestial-firebrand) for parties wanting to transition to no heal runs.

</Warning>

It provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/> and a decent amount of might. Exactly like the meta-counterpart it provides good offensive support via <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>, it is important to understand that the signet share is essential to faster runs and sharing extra power during <Effect name="Exposed"/> (broken Defiance bar). The main source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> is <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/>; <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> is optional.

The <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> heals with any symbols, dodges, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>, and if necessary <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/>. If your group is unable to stay alive, you can swap out your offensive support (<Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and radiance) to virtues for more heals, _but_ it should not be needed.

When <Instability name="Afflicted"/> is present or enemies are applying conditions, you can use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> (Staff3) and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> (Staff2) for area condition cleanse.

If you play this build we highly recommend learning the <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> share variant. If you want a good and smooth run, take a look at the [Fractal Pages](/fractals). This class will not be doing much damage but understanding how the class works best and when to do <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> sharing is important!

These guides provide an in depth description on how to deal damage in CMs. Our guides merely represent a suggestion of what works decently. In an actual fight you might have to apply your profession knowledge to skip, add or alter the rotation on the fly. As you collect more experience, this will come naturally. These pages provide hints for you: for example on what weapon set you should be in which phase, what kind of CC skills you should be using. Maybe there are variations in sigils or utility skills?

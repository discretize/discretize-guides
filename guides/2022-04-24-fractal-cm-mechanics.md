# What is Damage Mitigation?

- Damage mitigation quite simply means reducing how much damage the players in the party are taking. Imagine a total amount of damage players have taken at the end of the fight, use arc DPS to gauge this, this includes damage received from conditions as well as direct dmg. Everything that helps reduce both incoming dmg and incoming condition dmg count as forms of damage mitigation. <Boon name="Protection"/> and dmg reduction modifiers would also reduce the total dmg players received at the end of the fight too! <Boon name="Stability"/> is a form of crowd control mitigation; instead of preventing or reducing dmg directly, it will prevent the possibility of players taking unnecessary damage in the future.
- Crowd control mitigation can be equally important as healing. And is often referred to as a form of indirect damage mitigation. What does crowd control mitigation mean? Well the definition of crowd control is simply "a set of effects that temporarily prevent actions or movement". There are not many forms of CC mitigation in gw2, the one we will be focussing on is <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- Damage mitigation although linked, runs parallel to healing itself. What this means; is that if your class allows it, you should consider healing with the SAME priority as damage mitigation! It is as important to heal as it is to reduce the incoming damage. Most would argue, in fact, that damage mitigation is vastly more important.
- If the priority is the group and damage mitigation is the goal; then there are several forms of damage mitigation that need consideration when healing your teammates. 
- Damage mitigation. when in conjunction with CC mitigation, for the purpose of this <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> guide; will include: <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> and reflect (where appropriate)

# What Boons will I need?

- In this section of the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> guide we will aim to highlight the importance of using damage mitigation properly and which mechanics have priority when timing your damage mitigation skills.
- <Boon name="Aegis"/>: \"Is a boon that will block the single next incoming attack of any kind\" The significance of this cannot be understated! If we consider the total damage your teammates have taken at the end of the fight; <Boon name="Aegis"/> is able to block an attack that hits for 1,000 or an attack that might hit for 9,000. Instead of taking 9,000 damage your 4 teammates will take 0. It is therefore incredibly important to learn how to time your <Boon name="Aegis"/> application in order to maximise your damage mitigation.
- <Boon name="Stability"/>: \"Is a boon that protects against control effects and each incoming control effect removes a single stack\". As mentioned ABOVE <Boon name="Stability"/> is a form of CC mitigation, which proves AS important as DIRECT dmg mitigation. This is because upon being CC'd any player under the effect may be unable to move. <Boon name="Stability"/> is described as \"INDIRECT\" as it is with this boon that you can completely negate an incoming CC attack. And in turn through negating that incoming attack, will ensure your teammates aren’t caught out of position or unable to move. Not knowing how to use <Boon name="Stability"/> as a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> will be detrimental to your groups survival.
- <Boon name="Protection"/>: \"Is a boon that reduces direct damage by 33%\" <Boon name="Protection"/> is a form of dmg mitigation which PuG META group’s often overlook. It is YOUR JOB as a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> to ensure the renegade is running <Boon name="Protection"/> with \"all for one\" and that you use your own <Boon name="Protection"/> application for critical high pressure moments.
- <Boon name="Resistance"/>: \"Is a boon that temporarily negates the affected target of all effects caused by conditions\" Instead of taking, stacking, condition damage over time which would often increase in potency as the boss continues attacking. All teammates under the effect of <Boon name="Resistance"/> will take 0 condition damage whatsoever. Pair this with the 0 incoming direct damage from well-timed <Boon name="Aegis"/> and it becomes a powerful combo.
- Reflect: \"Is a combat mechanic that returns incoming projectile attacks to their source, including the properties of the projectiles.\" What this means is that if a player reflects a projectile; if that projectile would otherwise apply <Condition name="Chilled"/>, <Condition name="Immobile"/>, <Condition name="Burning"/>	 etc or CC (crowd control as mentioned above <Control name="Knockback"/>, <Control name="Knockdown"/>, <Control name="Stun"/> etc) it will do nothing to the players and instead reflect back at the boss. This includes adds, on sirens reef for example! Situational, well timed, reflect can therefor play a huge part in damage mitigation when playing <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>.

## MAMA 

##### Cascade of Torment (Beyblade attack): 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
Let it rip! This mama attack sees her coiling upwards, charging a lethal attack. Upon finishing her spin animation, she will do lethal damage to you and your teammates. It is your job as a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> (and <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Power Firebrand"/> for that matter) to ensure to block this mechanic. Use the timing showed in the gif to gauge when to block it. As you can see the timing is crucial; this is due to multiple overlapping AoEs all of which that can strip poorly timed <Boon name="Aegis"/>!
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>

##### Grenade Barrage: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
This mechanic is often overlooked when playing <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>. Some wouldn’t even consider reflecting on MAMA whatsoever... It is in fact a HUGE portion of your damage mitigation on MAMA. The grenade barrage projectiles themselves do not do a great deal of damage. It is the AoEs that they spawn which can be lethal... If the "bubble" mechanic spawns BEFORE you phase to 75% (or more commonly known as: "failing the DPS check 100-75") the boss will use these projectiles while you are killing the first knight. If you meet the DPS check, however, it will likely spawn while your killing the SECOND knight. So pay attention to the bosses telegraphs.
</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>

##### Leap:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
This mechanic is another great example of lethal damage in gw2. It can ONE SHOT a player regardless of HP. It is therefore of great importance that the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> prioritises their <Boon name="Aegis"/> for this attack specifically. If the group DPS is high and the final watchwork knight (add) has died quickly too, use the FINAL charge of your heal mantra (as a last resort) to ensure the attack is blocked for your teammates.
</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Triple Wave:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
This attack works in conjunction with "leap" and sees Mama shoot three shock waves immediately after landing. Not unsurprisingly MAMA will often "Leap" towards players while they are killing the final watchwork knight and it is because of this the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> should consider using CC mitigation to prevent the chain <Control name="Knockback"/> the triple wave causes. Not merely this, the knight itself can cause <Control name="Knockdown"/>. The <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> should aim to always aCCompany <Boon name="Aegis"/> with multiple stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> for the "Leap/Triple wave" combo in order to prevent being chain CC'd while dealing with overlapping mechanics at the final knight. Using the final charge of your elite mantra in order to provide multiple stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> in this late stage of the fight is perfectly acceptable.
</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Tantrum:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
This attack can easily be blocked with careful timing of <Boon name="Aegis"/>. By blocking this attack effectively, the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> would prevent players from being knocked down. MAMA will only use the "Tantrum" attack below 33% HP. It is during this time that players often will deal with MAMA's attacks overlapping with that of the final watchwork knight. It therefor becomes quite important to try to block the "pizza slices" of the tantrum attack.
</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>

## Siax 


##### Summon nightmare hallucination: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
Using <Boon name="Aegis"/> to block this attack is the single most important role that <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> plays in the Siax encounter. Siax is otherwise not a very difficult fight at all. Try to time <Boon name="Aegis"/> application as shown in the gif, while being in range of all your teammates to ensure that no nightmare hallucinations spawn. If 4 players are inside the AoE, without dodging or <Boon name="Aegis"/> application; 4 nightmare hallucinations will spawn. It is recommended in the guide that a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> takes <Skill name="Retreat"/> to help with <Boon name="Aegis"/> application. This is due to instabilities like <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> where a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> should always strive to time <Boon name="Aegis"/> to block the <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> projectiles AS WELL as ensuring to block the "nightmare hallucination" AoEs.
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Summon nightmare hallucination" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712375049158656/Siax_Mech_1.webm"/>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Tail Lash, Summon volatile hallucination, (Vile spit):  
<Grid>
<GridItem>

This is the only "high pressure" situation on siax where potentially three mechanics can overlap. Two have been illustrated in the gif: Tail lash and summon volatile hallucination. Tail lash is a direct damage attack which does a fair amount of damage. It also <Control name="Knockdown"/> players. Volatile hallucinations, when a group is stacking correctly, will all aggro and explode directly in middle. The green damage fields from "vile spit" might also be near middle during this "high pressure" situation. It is therefor very important to gauge whether or not the situation requires a high level of damage mitigation. Depending on how many mechanics overlap, is what you commit to this scenario. If two or more mechanics overlap, it is recommended that you use tome <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> to provide <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Resistance"/>. If all three mechanics overlap, it would be appropriate to use <Skill name="Tome of resolve"/>  to top everyone off. Placing <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> reflect can also be used to mitigate projectiles from <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/>

</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Tail Lash, Summon volatile hallucination" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712370234490881/Siax_Mech_2.webm"/>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Summon nightmare hallucination, Tail lash:  
<Grid>
<GridItem>

Another example of the importance of providing <Boon name="Aegis"/> for the group. Both attacks are consecutive and the "nightmare hallucination" AoE requires a fair amount of attention in order to block all of them. If you are towards the end of the fight and have somewhat decent DPS it can be acceptable (as a last resort) to use the final charge of your heal mantra to provide emergency <Boon name="Aegis"/>.
</GridItem>

## Ensolyss 


##### Upswing: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
Is a direct dmg mechanic which deals a fair amount of HP. It shares some properties with other mechanics in fractals in that it is tied to a "tidal wave". In order to actually block the orange AoE itself the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> must carefully time <Boon name="Aegis"/> after the wave has passed. In order for teammates not to be interrupted, or have the <Boon name="Aegis"/> stripped by the tidal wave before the AoE hits, the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> should tie a single stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> to provide CC mitigation alongside damage mitigation from <Boon name="Aegis"/>. When the attack hits, the single stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> will be stripped by the wave leaving the <Boon name="Aegis"/> intact. <Boon name="Aegis"/> alone cannot be used to block both attacks. The tidal wave itself can <Control name="Knockback"/>, with the third overlapping orange AoE being lethal dmg. It is important to provide <Boon name="Stability"/> so players aren’t <Control name="Knockback"/> before the set of orange AoEs hit. Reflect has also been used in this gif to illustrate the negation of <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> projectiles.
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Upswing" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712445954129920/Ensol_mech_1.webm"/>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Tail Lash:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
The gif tied to this mechanic illustrates how <Boon name="Aegis"/> can be used to block a series of consecutive attacks instead of only specific ones. <Boon name="Aegis"/> in this scenario is used to block two auto attacks (which apply condition dmg from bleeding and direct dmg too) and "Tail lash" from siax. Tail lash itself does a fair amount of direct dmg as well as applies <Control name="Knockdown"/> to any teammates caught by it. It is a perfect example of the boss using three consecutive attacks and your teammates don’t take a single tick of incoming dmg from any of them. Interestingly if all players are stacked tightly inside the centre of the hitbox for ensol, the furthest person from the epicentre of the hitbox will take auto attack aggro. This means, as illustrated in the gif, it’s entirely possible for the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> to "tank" ensols attacks. Bear in mind, however, that you DO NOT want ensol moving around a crazy amount (he has no issue in teleporting across the platform to the furthest person!), and that the "tank" fixation should only be very subtle movements within or close to the centre of the hitbox.

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Lunge: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
Is an attack that hits multiple times as ensol charges across the platform. Each hit from the attack can <Control name="Knockback"/>. The series of attacks the lunge consists of, is enough to be instantly downed. The gif illustrates <Boon name="Aegis"/>'s usefulness in preventing the mechanic. <Boon name="Aegis"/> will block one of multiple attacks which would have potentially downed all 4 players and <Control name="Knockback"/> in the process. Not having provided <Boon name="Aegis"/> may have resulted in multiple downstates. In order to prevent the CC effect of this attack, the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> must use multiple stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/>. Even after preventing the effects of CC, players can take huge damage from this attack.
</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Caustic grasp: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
Of all the mechanics in fractals, if you do not block this one your DPS will most likely complain. As ude imagine, it’s a situation where DPS can remain continuous and uninterrupted. The mechanic itself is designed purely to annoy DPS players and if you fail to block it, players will be briefly <Control name="Pull"/>ed (enough to interrupt juicy DPS skills). It is not a lethal mechanic that desperately needs blocking but is one that is a healthy habit to get into.

</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Caustic grasp" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712438814769162/Ensol_mech_4.webm"/>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Charge (below 15%):
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
Both <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> are effective at both mitigating the direct damage the charge attack applies and mitigating the <Control name="Knockback"/> it applies also. During this phase anyone not stood inside the protective bubble will take ticking damage from the damage field, which isnt insignificant damage either. For a player to be knocked into this damage field and down would result in their death. It is therefore important during this 15% damage phase to mitigate every incoming charge attack, alternating between <Boon name="Aegis"/> application and <Boon name="Stability"/>. Using the final charge of your heal mantra during this late stage in the fight is not unacceptable.


</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>

## Skorvald 


##### Anomaly knockback:  
<Grid>
<GridItem>

The tidal wave emitted from the anomaly on the 4th island can <Control name="Knockback"/>. During the death of this 4th anomaly the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> is looking to do three major things: top up <Boon name="Might"/>, top up <Boon name="Quickness"/> and precast <Skill name="Bane signet"/> before taking the portal back for the 66-33 burn phase. If nothing else, application of <Boon name="Stability"/> at this moment of the fight is crucial in order to properly buff your team before a burn phase. Not merely this, however, many a group will potentially wipe from not killing the add fast enough. It is common practice in PuG groups to see players leave the 4th platform to precast and wiping after the portal dies. Players being interrupted by <Control name="Knockback"/> on this final platform would only increase the probability of the 4th add not dying.
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Anomaly knockback" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712648891465738/Skorv_Mech_1.webm"/>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Solar Bloom:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
Due to the ancient method of "pushing the solar bloom away from the group" dying, with players instantly DPS burning from 66-33 and then 33-0; removing the mechanic entirely... Most groups have forgotten how lethal the "solar bloom" is. If you find yourself in a position where the "solar bloom" is a threat to the group and might explode, ensure to use <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Boon name="Stability"/> to prevent its <Control name="Knockback"/> CC effect. If a player does get <Control name="Knockback"/> by this attack, it will <Control name="Knockback"/> the player the distance of the radius of the entire platform. Meaning that the only scenario where a player would not be knocked off of the platform entirely, is if they were stood directly in the centre of the arena. (which is decidedly unlikely)  
</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Solar Cyclone: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
This is the single most important attack to mitigate for a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> on this encounter. Solar cyclone hits for a large amount, in a chain attack; multiple times. It also applies agony which does damage every 3s and reduces outgoing healing by 70% per stack! A single stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/> can prevent a single stack of agony. It is therefore especially important to try to block each attack as skorvald rotates through as well as providing <Boon name="Stability"/> so players aren’t knocked.
</GridItem>

</Grid>

<Divider/>

## Artsariiv 


##### Beaming smile:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
If a player finds themselves facing the boss, or "eye of Sauron" they will be <Condition name="Fear"/>ed. It is the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>'s job at the start of the artsariiv encounter to ensure everyone has a single stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> to prevent players from being <Condition name="Fear"/>ed. <Boon name="Aegis"/> will have no effect.
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Beaming smile" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712832308248576/Arts_Mech_1.webm"/>

</Grid>


##### Upswing:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
Is a direct dmg mechanic which deals a fair amount of HP. It shares some properties with other mechanics in fractals in that it is tied to a "tidal wave". In order to block the orange AoE itself the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> must carefully time <Boon name="Aegis"/> after the wave has passed. For teammates not to be interrupted, or have the <Boon name="Aegis"/> stripped by the tidal wave before the AoE hits, the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> should tie a single stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> to provide CC mitigation alongside damage mitigation from <Boon name="Aegis"/>. When the attack hits, the single stack of <Boon name="Stability"/> will be stripped by the wave leaving the <Boon name="Aegis"/> intact. <Boon name="Aegis"/> alone cannot be used to block both attacks. The mechanic and boss animation are almost identical. (ensolyss and artsariiv) Time <Boon name="Aegis"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> together to mitigate its effects.
</GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Red marble: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
The red marble projectile can be shot from both the larger artsariiv adds and the boss. although it is a projectile and can be reflected, on artsariiv reflect should only be done by DPS players. It is there for the task of the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> to learn how to time <Boon name="Aegis"/> appropriately. When using <Boon name="Aegis"/> to block this attack, you should watch the animation telegraphed by the boss. As the boss hesitates in its attack chain and begins to move its scythe down use <Boon name="Aegis"/>. It enables players to face tank the mechanic, without being knocked down.
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Slam: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
A quite obviously large dark orange AoE that <Control name="Knockdown"/>'s players. You can use both <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/> to mitigate its effects. As far as learning <Boon name="Aegis"/> timing goes, several AoEs in gw2 share identical timing. So learning to time <Boon name="Aegis"/> for this attack is a great habit to get into.
</GridItem>

<Divider/>

## Arkk 


##### Blinding radiance: 
<Grid>
<GridItem>
 
The "eye of Sauron" takes many forms. On arkk its referred to as "blinding radiance." It has the same effect as artsariiv's eye mechanic and the <Boon name="Stability"/> timing is identical as illustrated in the gif. Use <Boon name="Stability"/> to negate the effects of <Condition name="Fear"/>.
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Laser beams (DDR):
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
Although technically unnamed the laser beams don’t only spawn sub15% with the DDR. They also spawn during split phases and have lethal damage if a player is hit by them. It is incredibly important as a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> to negate lethal damage mechanics. Try to time <Boon name="Aegis"/> as precisely as possible to avoid it being stripped by adds(for example).
</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Laser beams" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712881729208330/Ark_mech_2.webm"/>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Starburst cascade:
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
Below 60% HP arkk sends out a wave that can easily blocked by <Boon name="Aegis"/> or jumped over. When hit, a player will be <Control name="Float"/>>ed by the attack. Try to time <Boon name="Aegis"/> before the attack hits. As shown in the gif. It has a small "charging up" animation before shooting out the wave, just after that animation finishes use <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

</GridItem>

<GridItem>

<GifPlayer caption="Starburst cascade" url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376359522203205642/759712883281100810/Ark_Mech_3.webm"/>

</GridItem>
</Grid>


##### Solar flurry/solar discharge (reflect):
<Grid>
<GridItem>
  
This is a situational usage of reflect that can save a lot of trouble for groups that are new. There is one attack between 40-30% HP where all players must use hypernova launch. While the platforms are falling, the anomaly needs killing, and players are avoiding damage from the adds that were not cleaved during split phase... sometimes players forget to use SAC (hyper nova launch) specifically during this phase. When playing <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> on arkk we recommend that during this 40-30% phase you reflect the solar flurry so that no agony AoEs can spawn on the already limited playable area.

##### Horizon strike/Diffracting edge:

Pizza slices! A remarkably easy telegraph indicated with orange AoEs(pizza slices) blasting one by one counter-clockwise. Can be blocked with <Boon name="Aegis"/> or mitigated with <Boon name="Stability"/>. Does medium damage to a player hit by it while <Boon name="Stability"/> is up. Diffracting edge is simply where all pizza slices blast at the same time. While the playable area depletes (sub 40%), it is crucial for the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> to block these attacks.

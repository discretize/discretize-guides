<Message>
This build is [META](/guides/meta-explained) in Sunqua Peak. Outside Sunqua Peak in faster groups this build will fall behind <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> or <Specialization name="Guardian"/> - the power damage counterparts.
</Message>

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** can provide permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> (if necessary) to the party while dealing high consistent DPS. In organized teams this build is inferior to <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Power Firebrand"/> because it takes too much time to ramp up the damage. For slower groups however you can achieve very competitive results making DPS players sweat. Your tomes are by far your most important skills, they enable you to do great DPS as well as support and heal your allies. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls. 

This build has tremendous amounts of self-sustain and is therefore also a great build for soloing content:
- Permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>.
- Good <Boon name = "Might"/> uptime.
- <Skill id="41780"/> for heals.
- <Skill id="42259"/> for <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and damage reduction.
- Optionally: <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for a 6s long high HP regeneration.
 
One main downside of <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> is that you lack CC (Crowd Control), and missing the unique party wide +216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff provided by <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>. 

Overall this build is one of the best picks for newer players, for PuGs as <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider or for people that want to be more independent of their groups.

<Divider text="Equipment"/>

- Note that this build variant gains boon duration from the <Item id="79722"/> and <Item id="48916"/>. To keep up permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> you will need to reach 24.6% boon duration. For longers fights drop <Item id="24560"/> for <Item id="72339"/>.
- If u have low might uptime you can change <Item id="24560"/> to <Item id="24562"/>
- Playing the raid DPS build with this traits performs almost identically.

### Full DPS variant
You can play <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> as a DPS by making minor adjustments to the build.

### Organized Sunqua Peak group
This build assumes the <Composition name="_CRGB" />. <BuildLink specialization="Soulbeast" build="Condi Soulbeast"/> provides <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> which greatly increases the duration of applied <Boon name="Quickness"/> and allows <Skill name="Renewed Focus" /> to be played for an additional Tome reset. Both <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> have to play this build!

<Divider text="Details"/>

To keep up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:

- Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready
- Use <Skill name="	mantraofsolace"/> and <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/>. Keep in mind that <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> does <Boon name="Quickness"/> only every seven seconds (<Trait name="liberatorsvow"/>)!
- Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras
- Keep in mind that equipping or stowing a tome grants you 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!

Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA and hallucinations at Siax).

<Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.

- <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> (F1):
  - Skill 1: One stack of <Condition name="Burning"/>
  - Skill 2: Two stacks of <Condition name="Burning"/>
  - Skill 3: An AoE pull
  - Skill 4: High power damage skill, applies five stacks of <Condition name="Burning"/>.
  - Skill 5: Your bread and butter as <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>: Share Ashes of the Just with allies applying a magnitude of <Condition name="Burning"/>.
- <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> (F2):
  - Skill 2 is a party condition cleanse
  - Skill 3 grants <Boon name="Vigor"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>
  - Skill 4 is a good party heal
  - Skill 5 increases healing on allies for 8s by 33% and converts up to 5 conditions to boons
- <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> (F3):
  - Skill 1 grants <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>
  - Skill 3 is a 5s reflect
  - Skill 4 grants <Boon name="Resistance"/> and breaks stun
  - Skill 5 grants <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and 300 toughness for 5 seconds

1) Take the _Mistlock Singularity_ 
1) Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> again

      The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** can
      provide permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> (if necessary) to the party
      while dealing high consistent DPS. Your tomes are by far your most
      important skills, they enable you to do great DPS as well as support and
      heal your allies. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various
      situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>,
      reflects and pulls.


      This build has tremendous amounts of self-sustain and is therefore also a great build for soloing content:


      - Permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>.


      - Some <Boon name="Might"/> uptime.


      - <Skill id="41780"/> for heals.


      - <Skill id="42259"/> for <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and damage reduction.


      - Optionally: <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for a 6s long high HP regeneration.


      Overall this build is one of the best picks for newer players, for PuGs as <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider or for people that want to be more independent of their groups.

      - Note that this build variant gains boon duration from the <Item
      id="79722"/> and <Item id="48916"/>. To keep up permanent <Boon
      name="Quickness"/> you will need to reach 24.6% boon duration. For longer
      fights drop <Item id="24560"/> for <Item id="72339"/>.


      - If you have low might uptime you can change <Item id="24560"/> to <Item id="24562"/>

      To keep up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:


      - Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready


      - Use <Skill name=" mantraofsolace"/> and <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/>. Keep in mind that <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> does <Boon name="Quickness"/> only every seven seconds (<Trait name="liberatorsvow"/>)!


      - Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras


      - Keep in mind that equipping or stowing a tome grants you 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!


      Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA and hallucinations at Siax).


      <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.


      - <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> (F1):

        - Skill 1: One stack of <Condition name="Burning"/>

        - Skill 2: Two stacks of <Condition name="Burning"/>

        - Skill 3: An AoE pull

        - Skill 4: High power damage skill, applies five stacks of <Condition name="Burning"/>.

        - Skill 5: Your bread and butter as <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>: Share Ashes of the Just with allies applying a magnitude of <Condition name="Burning"/>.

      - <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> (F2):

        - Skill 2 is a party condition cleanse

        - Skill 3 grants <Boon name="Vigor"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>

        - Skill 4 is a good party heal

        - Skill 5 increases healing on allies for 8s by 33% and converts up to 5 conditions to boons

      - <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> (F3):

        - Skill 1 grants <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>

        - Skill 3 is a 5s reflect

        - Skill 4 grants <Boon name="Resistance"/> and breaks stun

        - Skill 5 grants <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and 300 toughness for 5 seconds

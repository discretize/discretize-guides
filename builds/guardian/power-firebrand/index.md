The **<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** (also **_Quickness Firebrand_** or **_Quickbrand_**) provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> to the party while dealing very decent DPS.

It plays very similar to <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> with the addition of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> mantras and tomes. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls.

Using <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars also increases your allies' <Attribute name="Power"/> by 216 for 10 seconds thanks to <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.

<Warning>
Its worth mentioning that <Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> is exceedingly strong when bosses phase quickly. For various T4 fractals, long fights or if you happen to be in a slower group (most PuG groups), you want to run <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> as it provides much higher sustained DPS.
</Warning>

<Divider text="Details"/>

To keep up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:

- Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready

- Use <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/>

- Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras

- Keep in mind that equipping/stowing a tome grants you 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!

The DPS rotation is the same as [Power Dragonhunter](/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter):

- If the encounter allows you to, you can prestack the following symbols:

  - Equip Mace and precast <Skill name="Symbol of Faith"/>

  - Equip Scepter and precast <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/>

  - And finally, equip Sword and cast <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>

  - This way, when the encounter starts, 3 symbols will hit the target and get up your stacks of <Trait name="symbolicavenger"/>

- On greatsword:

  - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>, you should cancel the aftercast with weapon stowing or simply moving

  - Use <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> while standing in a symbol inside the target's hitbox (if done correctly it results in 14 hits)

- On Sword:

  - Use <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/>, try if possible to cancel the aftercast with weapon swap, stow or <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>

  - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>

  - Use <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/>

  - <Skill name="Shield of Wrath"/> when you're not receiving hits - use it shortly before breaking defiance bars. Can also be used to help with stacking <Boon name="Might"/>

- Apart from that:

  - <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars and provide the group with a temporary 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff

  - <Skill id="9226"/> (after <Skill id="9147"/>) is nice CC skill as well

  - <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/> for additional DPS and vulnerability. Also provides 3 seconds of <Condition name="Crippled"/>

  - Scepter plays the same as the sword, just without <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/>

Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Skorvald/Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA and hallucinations at Siax).

<p>
<Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.
</p>

- <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> (F1):

  - <TomeSkill name="chapterscorchedaftermath"/> is a ticking AoE, good for single target and great for AoE DPS, provides fire field so make sure to use it before the fight to stack some might

  - <TomeSkill name="epilogue ashes of the just"/> makes your surrounding allies inflict <Condition name="Burning"/> - worth using as precast

  - <TomeSkill name="Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke"/> is an AoE pull (150 defiance bar damage)

  - Often these skills are used as an opener

- <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> (F2):

  - Skill 2 is a party condition cleanse

  - Skill 3 grants <Boon name="Vigor"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>

  - Skill 4 is a good party heal

  - Skill 5 increases healing on allies for 8s by 33% and converts up to 5 conditions to boons

- <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> (F3):

  - Skill 1 grants <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>

  - Skill 3 is a 5s reflect

  - Skill 4 grants <Boon name="Resistance"/> and breaks stun

  - Skill 5 grants <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and 300 toughness for 5 seconds

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here.

It is very much recommended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> since it provides much better DPS compared to the power variant. If you still want to play <Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> for whatever reason follow these rough guidelines.

- Open with <Skill name="refraction"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/>

- Cast <Skill name="purify"/> and swap to spear. Camp spear now.

- Priority list:

  1.  <Skill name="Zealots flurry"/> (Spear 2)

  2.  <Skill name="Symbol of spears"/> (Spear 4)

  3.  <Skill name="brilliance"/> (Spear 3)

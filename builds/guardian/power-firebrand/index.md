      The **<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand"
      name="Firebrand"/>** (also **_Quickness Firebrand_** or **_Quickbrand_**)
      provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> to the party while dealing
      very decent DPS.


      It plays very similar to <BuildLink build="Power Dragonhunter" specialization="Dragonhunter"/> with the addition of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> mantras and tomes. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls.


      Using <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars also increases your allies' <Attribute name="Power"/> by 216 for 10 seconds thanks to <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.


      <Warning>

      Its worth mentioning that \*<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>\* is exceedingly strong when bosses phase quickly. For various T4 fractals, long fights or if you happen to be in a slower group (most PuG groups), you want to run \*<BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/>\* as it provides much higher sustained DPS.

      </Warning>

      To keep up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:


      - Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready


      - Use <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/> and <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/>


      - Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras


      - Keep in mind that equipping/stowing a tome grants you 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!


      The DPS rotation is the same as [Power Dragonhunter](/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter):


      - If the encounter allows you to, you can prestack the following symbols:

        - Equip Mace and precast <Skill name="Symbol of Faith"/>

        - Equip Scepter and precast <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/>

        - And finally, equip Sword and cast <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>

        - This way, when the encounter starts, 3 symbols will hit the target and get up your stacks of <Trait name="symbolicavenger"/>

      - On greatsword:

        - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>, you should cancel the aftercast with weapon stowing or simply moving

        - Use <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> while standing in a symbol inside the target's hitbox (if done correctly it results in 14 hits)

      - On Sword:

        - Use <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/>, try if possible to cancel the aftercast with weapon swap, stow or <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>

        - Use <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>

        - Use <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/>

        - <Skill name="Shield of Wrath"/> when you're not receiving hits - use it shortly before breaking defiance bars. Can also be used to help with stacking <Boon name="Might"/>

      - Apart from that:

        - <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars and provide the group with a temporary 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff

        - <Skill id="9226"/> (after <Skill id="9147"/>) is nice CC skill as well

        - <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/> for additional DPS and vulnerability. Also provides 3 seconds of <Condition name="Crippled"/>

        - Scepter plays the same as the sword, just without <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/>

      Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA and hallucinations at Siax).


      <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.


      - <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> (F1):

        - Skill 4 is a ticking AoE, good for single target and great for AoE DPS, provides fire field so make sure to use it before the fight to stack some might

        - Skill 5 makes your surrounding allies inflict <Condition name="Burning"/> - worth using as precast

        - Skill 3 is an AoE pull (150 defiance bar damage)

        - Often these skills are used as an opener

      - <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> (F2):

        - Skill 2 is a party condition cleanse

        - Skill 3 grants <Boon name="Vigor"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>

        - Skill 4 is a good party heal

        - Skill 5 increases healing on allies for 8s by 33% and converts up to 5 conditions to boons

      - <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> (F3):

        - Skill 1 grants <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>

        - Skill 3 is a 5s reflect

        - Skill 4 grants <Boon name="Resistance"/> and breaks stun

        - Skill 5 grants <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and 300 toughness for 5 seconds

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">
<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here.

It is very much recommended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> since it provides much better DPS compared to the power variant. If you still want to play <Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> for whatever reason follow these rough guidelines.

- Open with <Skill name="refraction"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/>

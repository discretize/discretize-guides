While there is no dedicated healing or tanking classes in Guild Wars 2, I've designed this build to provide the closet equivalent to a Paladin Healer or "Healadin" for fractal runs. The builds survivability is extremly high at the expense of DPS. This is the best heal build to play in fractals and **FAR** better than that toxic elitist signet share <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Radiant Heal Firebrand"/>!

<Divider text="The support Manifesto"/>
<div>
<Warning>

**It is important to rmember you are irreplacable! You are the sole reason your party completes a fractal with a huge carry, they are lucky to have you! The manifesto below outlines all the things you do for your group, so you know exactly what to say if they complain.**

</Warning>

So, as we've already got a DPS player complaining about supports, I'll shed some light on the things that I'm doing that many DPS players aren't, so that they aren't getting abused with their super aggressive, often brainless gameplay.

1. I'm managing Fractal Instabilities like <Instability name="no pain, no gain"/> & <Instability name="Vengeance"/> so that you don't have to. Making sure that you can do an "extra" 33% more damage and don't have to learn how to play classes like <Specialization name="Chronomancer"/> or <Specialization name="Reaper"/>. Try doing Twilight Oasis with out boon-strip. It is not a fun experience and it really messes with our DPS.
2. I'm providing important boons like <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Boon name="Stability"/> so that you don't get knocked off the 2nd/4th islands.
3. I'm providing <Skill name="Wall of Reflection" text="reflects"/> in-case you get greedy and decide 200-300 DPS is worth more than your life.
4. I'm adapting my rotation around variable DPS from one day to the next whereas you're at most playing around break-bars and dodging big telegraphs. My rotation is far more "fluid" than yours because it varies both with the skill levels of the players that I'm playing with, the DPS they achieve and the demands instabilities make on my gameplay.
5. Oh yes, Break-Bars - I'm often using <Item id="8679" text="Consumable CC"/> because your rotation is more important than teamplay, and saving those skills to help out with break-bars would be a "dps loss."
6. So ^ I'm breaking out <Item id="8679"/> and ~~<Item id="8674"/>~~ because you're a headache. If you aren't contributing any CC then kindly go !@#$ yourself. When you make us break all these out kys. They're awkward and it is not fun to use multiple <Item id="8679" text="Consumable CC"/> items with ungrateful PuGs.
7. I'm <Control name="Stun" text="Stunning"/>, <Control name="pull" text="Pulling"/> and <Condition name="taunt" text="Taunting"/>, dangerous enemies that you rush into.
8. I'm providing <Boon name="stability"/>, <Boon name="resistance"/> and <Boon name="aegis"/> when you need them. Try playing without them, hrm? hrm?!
9. I'm thinking ahead about what boons, skills, and utilities we'll need before we need them. "Responsibility."
10. I'm making more overall decisions related to the entire party than you will do in every daily Fractal because all you have to do is play variations of the same song. Congrats you're a <Item id="82432" text="Music Box"/>.

I have to keep tabs on the DPS, the skill-level (survivability) and the instability augments (eg; <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/>). I go through several tool-kits worth of problem-solving to ensure that you either (a) don't get hit, (b) get hit don't take damage or (c) are instantly-cleansed before you lose 3/4ths of your HP on your <Specialization name="Scourge"/> and <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>.

So, yeah, piss supports off, and we'll just run with friends. Many of the players that excel at playing support-classes have deep class pools -- you need us more than we need you. I don't have to pug Fractals at reset. I can grab a bunch of a friends a few hours later and we'll get through them much faster than with a bunch of DPS obsessed gremlins.

<Divider text="Details"/>

The unsung hero of the Honor trait line is <Trait name="Selfless Daring"/> which gives you an AOE heal everytime you dodge roll. Coupled with <Trait name="Vigorous Precision"/> and <Item id="24607"/> this one Trait will account for a great amount of passive healing during normal play. You also have; <Trait name="Invigorated Bulwark"/> provides +5% healing to allies, <Trait name="Pure of Heart"/> procs when aegis procs providing a large self heal to yourself to keep you on your feet and <Trait name="Force of Will"/> provides +15% healing to allies, if coupled with all Cleric gear.

In Valor <Trait name="Smiter's Boon"/> works in conjunction with <Trait name="Monk's Focus"/> to provide healing to allies whenever a Meditation skill is used. Meanwhile <Trait name="Stalwart Defender"/> enhances shield capabilities. Finally <Trait name="Monk's Focus"/> causes all Meditation skills to heal allies.

In Firebrand <Trait name="Archivist of Whispers"/> provides extra tome pages which allow you to cast more skills that grant Protection, Regen and Stability. <Trait name="Legendary Lore"/> simply increases the passive effects of tomes. <Trait name="Lore Master"/> allows you to retain the passive effects of Tomes even when you are using them, this means that you can freely use Tomes without penalty.

All Tomes are built in a similar way:

- Skill 1 creates an effect in a cone in front of you.
- Skill 2 creates an effect around you.
- Skill 3 is a ground target skill.
- Skill 4 creates a field.
- Skill 5 grants a unique buff to your allies.

<Skill name="Tome of Justice" />:

- Use this Tome mainly for providing a Fire Field.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Searing Spell"/> and <Skill name="Chapter 2: Igniting Burst"/> are mostly useless on <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke"/> is a CC. It pulls enemies together and can be used from range.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/> creates a Fire Field that can be used to blast <Boon name="Might"/>.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/> grants an effect to allies that makes them inflict burning on their next attacks.
- When running Radiance killing certain enemies will lower the cooldown on this Tome. Keep in mind this will not reset the skills in the Tome.
- A common rotation in this Tome is 4-(5)-exit.

<Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />:

- Use this Tome for emergency healing and cleansing.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Desert Bloom"/> heals in a cone in front of you.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> heals and cleanses conditions.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Azure Sun"/> gives some boons but will rarely be used.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Shining River"/> places a healing field that can also be blasted for extra healing.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> converts conditions into boons and grants allies an incoming healing modifier.
- When running Virtues entering this Tome also cleanses conditions.
- Common rotations in this Tome are 2-5-4-1-2 for maximum sustained healing or 5-4-2-1-1 for maximum burst healing.

<Skill name="Tome of Courage" />:

- Use this Tome for massive <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> or a reflect.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge"/> grants <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Daring Challenge"/> inflicts 1 second of <Condition name="Taunt"/> on the enemy which is a 75/s soft CC.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/> places a bubble that reflects incoming projectiles.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand"/> places a field that pulses <Boon name="Resistance"/> to allies. This will help dealing with non-damaging conditions such as <Condition name="Blinded"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> provides <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> as well as extra Toughness.
- There is no set rotation in this Tome, use whatever skills you need for their utility and make sure to press Skill 5 as it is an incredibly strong skill.
- You can camp in this Tome for a few extra seconds to get an extra cast on an important skill, for example a 2nd reflect. However only do this when absolutely needed as you will not have access to the boons and healing your weapon skills provide.

<Card title="Precast">

<Warning>

For maximum benefit you need to do a complicated precast rotation that uses almost every guardian skill off cooldown. Once you have mastered this you will be one of the best <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Healadin"/> players out there and is well worth the effort! This is the hard part of the rotation, after the precast it is easy.

</Warning>

Starting on Staff:

1.  <Skill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/> (Tome 1-4)
2.  <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> (Staff 2)
3.  _Swap to Axe / Focus_
4.  _Swap to Scepter / Focus_
5.  <Skill name="Symbol of Punishment"/> (Scepter 2)
6.  _Swap to Greatsword_
7.  <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> (Greatsword 4)

9.  _Swap to Staff_
10. <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> (Staff 3)
11. _Swap to Axe / Focus_
12. <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> (Axe 2)
13. <Skill name="Chapter 2: Daring Challenge"/> (Tome 3-2)
14. <Skill name="Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand"/> (Tome 3-4)
15. <Skill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> (Tome 3-5)
16. <Skill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/> (Tome 3-3)
17. <Skill name="Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge"/> (Tome 3-1)
18. <Skill name="Chapter 3: Azure Sun"/> (Tome 2-3)
19. <Skill name="Chapter 1: Desert Bloom"/> (Tome 2-1)
20. _Swap to Axe / Shield_
21. <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/> (Shield 4)
22. <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> (Axe 2)

While doing this spam your mantras off cooldown, and at the end of the rotation swap to Mace / Shield ready to start the fight.

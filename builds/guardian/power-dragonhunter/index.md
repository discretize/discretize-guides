      <Warning> 

      <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> is a meta build only if it replaces <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> and being the main source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> by taking <Skill name="feelmywrath"/>, which is used only in short encounters in higher end groups or when played in the <Composition name="_RGB"/> composition. 

      </Warning>


      <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> is good and easy to play build for fractals. It has great burst options and deals high consistent damage while providing medium defiance bar damage and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.

      The build offers a unique party wide offensive buff by sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> for 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> and also strong on-demand defensive support with <Skill id="30039"/> and other useful skills such as <Skill id="9251"/> and <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

      The <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> is rather self-sufficient thanks to blocks from <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/>, <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and a very strong heal skill (<Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>) that makes the player invincible for 6 seconds.

      It benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

    note: >-
      If you use <Trait name="Perfectinscriptions"/> you are lacking critical
      chance, therefore additional assassins pieces are required. You can of
      course mitigate this by increasing your <Attribute name="Agony
      Resistance"/>. You need at least  <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"
      text="203 Agony Resistance"/> to compensate the lacking <Attribute
      name="Precision"/>.  


      It is not recommended to run <Trait name="Righthandstrength"/> unless you have multiple <Specialization name="Guardian"/> or another source of <Boon name="Resolution"/>.

<div inject />

<Divider text="Details"/>

As a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> it is important to play <Trait name="perfectinscriptions"/> to be able to use the <Skill name="Banesignet"/> for 300 CC while also sharing the 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff with your allies. This enables everyone to deal more damage during critical parts of the fight when the boss is <Effect name="exposed"/>.

Generally it is important to apply <Boon name="Resolution"/> when you are about to burst for the <Trait name="retribution"/> modifier. Thanks to <Trait name="healersresolution"/> your heal skill applies long lasting <Trait name="retribution"/>. Since <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> and <Skill name="processionofblades"/> have almost the same cooldown they will line up well (<Skill name="processionofblades"/> has a slightly shorter cooldown thanks to <Trait name="piercinglight"/>). You can also trigger a <Skill id="13677"/> by losing health below the 75% threshold to trigger <Trait id="648"/>, however you need to be careful to not die.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>

<Grid>
<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">
<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason you will find some general notes for skill usage here.
</Card>

<Card title="Precasting">

If you have a Mistlock Singularity present you can use these skills for precasts:

1.  Cast <Skill name="litany of wrath"/> for <Boon name="Resolution"/>

2.  Use <Skill name="Save yourselves"/> or <Skill name="hallowedground"/>

3.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>

4.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>

5.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/>

6.  Take mistlock

7.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> again

</Card>
</GridItem>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">
<Card title="Notes on skill usage:">
-   Always start on sword

- Delay swapping to GS until the CC-bar is about to be broken. This is especially important at Ensolyss without instant CC.

- Always cast your <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits. Ideal with adds around.

- Always cast your <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits when adds are present. Can be abused at **Artsariiv**, **Arkk**, **Siax** and **Ensolyss**.

- Don't interrupt your GS auto-attack chain.

- In certain scenarios (precasting traps, starting with <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>) it can be beneficial to get your <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> out first.

- Don't waste your key skills on meaningless adds.

It is very much recommended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> since it provides much better DPS compared to the <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/>. If you still want to play <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> for whatever reason follow these rough guidelines.

- Open with <Skill name="refraction"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/>

- Cast <Skill name="purify"/> and swap to spear. Camp spear now.

- Priority list:

  1.  <Skill name="Zealots flurry"/> (Spear 2)

  2.  <Skill name="Symbol of spears"/> (Spear 4)

  3.  <Skill name="brilliance"/> (Spear 3)

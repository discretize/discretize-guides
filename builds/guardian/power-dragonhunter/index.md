Power Dragonhunter is a high-burst DPS class for fractals. It provides medium defiance bar damage (CC), high amounts of vulnerability through <Trait name="symbolicexposure"/>, and good defensive capabilities through <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>. At the cost of personal DPS, it can access <Specialization name="Guardian" text="Guardian"/>'s strong supportive utilities, such as <Skill name="standyourground" />, <Skill name="wallofreflection" />, and <Skill name="advance" />.

It has a decent toolkit for T4s through multiple leaps and teleports (<Skill name="wingsofresolve" />, <Skill name="leapoffaith" />, <Skill name="judgesintervention" />, <Skill name="mercifulintervention" />). 

Due to its bursty nature, Power Dragonhunter is reliant on fast CC and short phases in order to reach its full potential. The build benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

<Beginner>

Before progressing to the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You should be able to hit consistently high DPS, which you can verify with [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 150 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

It is important to apply <Boon name="Resolution"/> when you are about to burst for the <Trait name="retribution"/> and <Trait name="righteousinstincts" /> modifiers. Thanks to <Trait name="healersresolution"/> your heal skill applies long lasting <Boon name="Resolution" />. You can also trigger a <Skill id="13677"/> by losing health below the 75% threshold to trigger <Trait id="648"/>, however you need to be careful to not die.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason, you will find some general notes for skill usage here.

<Card title="Notes on skill usage:">

- Start on longbow
- Always cast your <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits. Ideal with adds around.
- Always cast your <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits when adds are present. Can be abused at **Artsariiv**, **Arkk**, **Siax**, and **Ensolyss**.
- Don't interrupt your GS auto-attack chain.
- In certain scenarios (precasting traps or symbols, starting with <Skill name="firestorm"/>) it can be beneficial to get your <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> out first.

<Card title="Step-by-Step Rotation">
**Step 1: Greatsword Skills**

The first step consists of using <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>, <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> and <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> off-cooldown (in this order of priority if multiple come up at the same time).

- <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> and <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> are your 2 biggest damaging weapon skills on the Greatsword.
- Make sure to be in the hitbox of the enemy whenever possible for <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> deals additional damage when casted inside a hitbox.
- <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> will deal more damage if you are in the hitbox while there are extra enemies around.

**Step 2: Trap + F1 Combo**

Next up, it is time to incorporate <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> and <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>.

- Try to always wait until both skills are up again and then cast <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/> first, followed by <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/>.
- Using <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> will tether you to your target making you deal increased damage while it is active due to <Trait name="Big Game Hunter"/>.
- Your trap <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/> deals high damage and you therefore should always cast it while being tethered to your target.
- If you kill certain enemies, your <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> will reset due to <Trait name="Renewed Justice"/>. Wait until you get your trap back to cast both of them unless the boss will phase or die before this happens.

The opener at this step looks like this:

1. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
2. <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
4. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
5. <Skill name="Binding Blade"/>

**Step 3: Sword of Justice**

Now it is time to incorporate another strong utility skill, <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>.

- <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/> has 3 maximum charges. It summons a sword that will deal damage and inflict <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on nearby enemies while it is active.
- Its recharge time aligns with the cooldown of <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> so we will always use 1 charge right before we cast our Trap + F1. This will enhance the burst damage further.
- The other charges may be used between other skill casts in our opener or any time we do not have another skill ready to use as we should always get one charge back when our F1 comes back up for our burst due to them having the same cooldown. Try to use them while tethered to an enemy with <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> for the extra damage.

**Step 4: Longbow skills**

Longbow can be used to increase your burst capabilities, which is especially important in fights with short or many phases. <Skill name="symbolofenergy" />, <Skill name="huntersward" /> and <Skill name="trueshot" /> can be used before swapping to greatsword at the beginning of a phase. Longbow also adds access to an additional CC skill through <Skill name="deflectingshot" />.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/>
4. <Skill name="Hunter's Ward"/>
5. <Skill name="True Shot"/>
6. Swap to Greatsword
7. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
8. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
9. <Skill name="Binding Blade"/>

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great burst damage and good consistent damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far.

The additional steps are:

- Incorporate your Longbow skills into the rotation.
- Weapon swap more often on fights with long phases, usually after using <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>/<Skill name="True Shot"/> twice on their respective weapon sets.
- Precasts: You can cast lasting skills such as <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/> before the fight starts to get your damage up earlier and have 1 less cast in your opener.

<Card title="Golem Rotation">

This video shows the full rotation on the golem. It will slightly vary from the step-by-step version. It also uses the raid setup so numbers will not be comparable.

<Divider text="Underwater combat"/>

It is very much recommended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> since it provides much better DPS compared to the <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/>. If you still want to play <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> for whatever reason follow these rough guidelines.

- Open with <Skill name="refraction"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/>
- Cast <Skill name="purify"/> and swap to spear. Camp spear now.
- Priority list:
  1.  <Skill name="Zealots flurry"/> (Spear 2)
  2.  <Skill name="Symbol of spears"/> (Spear 4)
  3.  <Skill name="brilliance"/> (Spear 3)

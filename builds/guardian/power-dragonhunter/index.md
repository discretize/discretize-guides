The <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> is a good and easy to play build for fractals. It has great burst options and deals high consistent damage while providing medium defiance bar damage and high <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>. The build offers a unique party wide offensive buff by sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> for 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> and also strong on-demand defensive support with <Skill id="30039"/> and other useful skills such as <Skill id="9251"/> and <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

The <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> has access to blocks with <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/>, <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and a very strong heal skill (<Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>) that makes the player invincible for 6 seconds. It also benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

Unfortunately, the <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> is relying on fast CC to capitalize on the immediate high burst damage. Playing this build in slower groups therefore might not be as rewarding as the condi builds of <Specialization name="Guardian"/>. Sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> with a party that can't capitalize on the unique buff might also be frustrating.

<Beginner>

Before progressing to the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You should be able to hit consistently high DPS, which you can verify with [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 150 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

As a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> it is important to play <Trait name="perfectinscriptions"/> to be able to use the <Skill name="Banesignet"/> for 300 CC while also sharing the 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff with your allies. This enables everyone to deal more damage during critical parts of the fight when the boss is <Effect name="exposed"/>.

Generally it is important to apply <Boon name="Resolution"/> when you are about to burst for the <Trait name="retribution"/> modifier. Thanks to <Trait name="healersresolution"/> your heal skill applies long lasting <Trait name="retribution"/>. Since <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> and <Skill name="processionofblades"/> have almost the same cooldown they will line up well (<Skill name="processionofblades"/> has a slightly shorter cooldown thanks to <Trait name="piercinglight"/>). You can also trigger a <Skill id="13677"/> by losing health below the 75% threshold to trigger <Trait id="648"/>, however you need to be careful to not die.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason, you will find some general notes for skill usage here.
</Card>

<Card title="Precasting">

If you have a Mistlock Singularity present you can use these skills for precasts:

1.  Cast <Skill name="litany of wrath"/> for <Boon name="Resolution"/>
2.  Use <Skill name="Save yourselves"/> or <Skill name="hallowedground"/>
3.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>
4.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>
5.  Use <Skill name="banesignet"/>
6.  Take mistlock
7.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> again

</Card>

<Card title="Notes on skill usage:">

- Always start on the sword
- Delay swapping to GS until the CC-bar is about to be broken. This is especially important at Ensolyss without instant CC.
- Always cast your <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits. Ideal with adds around.
- Always cast your <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the hitbox to get the additional hits when adds are present. Can be abused at **Artsariiv**, **Arkk**, **Siax**, and **Ensolyss**.
- Don't interrupt your GS auto-attack chain.
- In certain scenarios (precasting traps, starting with <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>) it can be beneficial to get your <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> out first.
- Don't waste your key skills on meaningless adds.

<Card title="Step-by-Step Rotation">

**Step 0: Bane Signet**

The <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> grants you a passive boost to your <Attribute name="Power"/>. Its active effect (when clicked) will inflict a high amount of CC (300 CC) on your target and share the passive with your allies for 10 seconds through <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>. Therefore, you want to do the following:

- If a Mistlock Singularity is present, cast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> there to share its buff right before you run into the fight, then take the singularity.
- If a boss starts with a break bar, you should cast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> at the start to help with breaking the bar while also sharing its passive to your allies to enhance their burst damage as well.
- If a boss does not get a break bar early into the fight, you can use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> before the fight starts to share the passive and start right with your burst when the boss spawns.

**Step 1: Greatsword Skills**

The first step consists of using <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>, <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> and <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> off-cooldown (in this order of priority if multiple come up at the same time).

- <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> and <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> are your 2 biggest damaging weapon skills on the Greatsword.
- Make sure to be in the hitbox of the enemy whenever possible for <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> deals additional damage when casted inside a hitbox.
- <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> will deal more damage if you are in the hitbox while there are extra enemies around.

**Step 2: Trap + F1 Combo**

Next up, it is time to incorporate <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> and <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>.

- Try to always wait until both skills are up again and then cast <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/> first, followed by <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/>.
- Using <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> will tether you to your target making you deal increased damage while it is active due to <Trait name="Big Game Hunter"/>.
- Your trap <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/> deals high damage and you therefore should always cast it while being tethered to your target.
- If you kill certain enemies, your <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> will reset due to <Trait name="Renewed Justice"/>. Wait until you get your trap back to cast both of them unless the boss will phase or die before this happens.

The opener at this step looks like this:

1. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
2. <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
4. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
5. <Skill name="Binding Blade"/>

**Step 3: Sword of Justice**

Now it is time to incorporate another strong utility skill, <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>.

- <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/> has 3 maximum charges. It summons a sword that will deal damage and inflict <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on nearby enemies while it is active.
- Its recharge time aligns with the cooldown of <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> so we will always use 1 charge right before we cast our Trap + F1. This will enhance the burst damage further.
- The other charges may be used between other skill casts in our opener or any time we do not have another skill ready to use as we should always get one charge back when our F1 comes back up for our burst due to them having the same cooldown. Try to use them while tethered to an enemy with <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/> for the extra damage.

**Step 4: Sword skills**

This last step will not contribute much to your consistent DPS but can increase your burst by a good amount which is especially important in fights with shorter phases. We will use <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/> and <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/> at the start of the fight, then swap to Greatsword and do our regular rotation.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Spear of Justice"/>
4. <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/>
5. <Skill name="Zealots Defense"/>
6. Swap to Greatsword
7. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
8. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
9. <Skill name="Binding Blade"/>

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great burst damage and good consistent damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far.

The additional steps are:

- Incorporate your Focus skills into the rotation, namely <Skill name="Ray of Judgment"/> and <Skill name="Shield of Wrath"/>.
- Weapon swap more often on fights with long phases, usually after using <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>/<Skill name="Zealots Defense"/> twice on the respective weapon set.
- Precasts: You can cast lasting skills such as <Skill name="Symbol of Blades"/> before the fight starts to get your damage up earlier and have 1 less cast in your opener.

It is very much recommended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> since it provides much better DPS compared to the <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/>. If you still want to play <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> for whatever reason follow these rough guidelines.

- Open with <Skill name="refraction"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/>
- Cast <Skill name="purify"/> and swap to spear. Camp spear now.

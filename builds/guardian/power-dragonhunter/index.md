<Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> is a high-burst DPS class for fractals. It provides medium defiance bar damage (CC), high amounts of vulnerability through <Trait name="symbolicexposure"/>, and good defensive capabilities through <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>. At the cost of personal DPS, it can access <Specialization name="Guardian" text="Guardian"/>'s strong supportive utilities, such as <Skill name="standyourground" />, <Skill name="wallofreflection" />, and <Skill name="advance" />. 

It also has a decent toolkit for skips in Tier 4 fractals with multiple leaps and teleports (<Skill name="wingsofresolve" />, <Skill name="leapoffaith" />, <Skill name="judgesintervention" />, <Skill name="mercifulintervention" />). 

Due to its bursty nature, <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/>  is reliant on fast CC and short phases in order to reach its full potential. The build benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

<Beginner>

Before progressing to the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You should be able to hit consistently high DPS, which you can verify with [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 150 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

It is very important to maintain <Boon name="Resolution"/> for <Trait name="righteousinstincts" /> and <Trait name="retribution"/>. <Trait name="healersresolution"/> causes your heal skill to apply ~10s of <Boon name="Resolution" />, and <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> provides ~6s of <Boon name="Resolution" />.

- When beginning phases after splits (e.g. Ensolyss), you likely will not have <Boon name="Resolution" />. Make sure to precast <Skill name="litanyofwrath" /> at the start of these phases so that you have <Boon name="Resolution" /> during your opener. This is especially important when beginning phases on Longbow as you will not have <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> up until late in your burst.

It may require some attention to maintain permanent <Boon name="Resolution" /> solo. Notable teammates who can aid with <Boon name="Resolution" /> uptime include: 
- <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Firebrands" />, if taking 
  - <Skill name="mantraofsolace" />

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason, you will find some general notes for skill usage here.
</Card>

<Card title="Precasting">

If you have a Mistlock Singularity present you can use these skills for precasts:

1.  Cast <Skill name="litany of wrath"/> for <Boon name="Resolution"/>
2.  Use <Skill name="Save yourselves"/> and/or <Skill name="hallowedground"/>
3.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>
4.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>
5.  Take mistlock
6.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> again

- Add <Skill name="shieldofcourage" /> if the team would benefit from precasted <Boon name="Aegis" />. Be wary of <Instability name="Vengeance"/> converting this to <Condition name="Weakness" />!

</Card>



<Card title="Notes on skill usage:">

- Cast <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> inside the boss' hitbox so the additional projectiles hit.
- Cancel your <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> and <Skill name="bindingblade" /> aftercasts to save time.
- Cast <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the boss' hitbox to multi-hit when adds are present. This is most common at **Siax** and **Ensolyss**, but also occurs at **Artsariiv**, **Arkk**, and **MAMA**.
- If running <Trait name="biggamehunter" /> and precasting traps, symbols, or <Skill name="firestorm"/>, open with <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> as soon as the boss is vulnerable.

<Card title="Step-by-Step Rotation">
**Step 1: Sword of Justice + Trap**

Start with <Skill name="swordofjustice"/> and <Skill name="processionofblades" />.
- <Skill name="swordofjustice" profession="guardian" /> and <Skill name="processionofblades" /> both have a wind up time before dealing all their damage. Use them at the start of your opener to maximize your burst.
- <Skill name="swordofjustice" profession="guardian" /> has 3 charges. The other charges can be used later in the rotation as filler.

**Step 2: Longbow skills**

Next, use <Skill name="symbolofenergy" /> (LB4), <Skill name="huntersward" /> (LB5), and <Skill name="trueshot" /> (LB2). 

- <Skill name="huntersward" /> is easy to cancel by queuing your next skill too early. Be careful not to cancel it with <Skill name="trueshot" />.
- <Skill name="deflectingshot" /> (LB3) is a CC skill. Use it to deal breakbar damage to bosses or when knockback is needed.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/>
4. <Skill name="Hunter's Ward"/>
5. <Skill name="True Shot"/>


**Step 3: Greatsword Skills**

From here on, cast <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> (GS4) and <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> (GS2) off-cooldown.

- <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> has a very long aftercast which can be cancelled to save time. This can be done by moving or stowing weapon after the symbol is placed.
- <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> fires additional damaging projectiles outwards. Try to stand inside the boss' hitbox so that these projectiles don't miss.



The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/>
4. <Skill name="Hunter's Ward"/>
5. <Skill name="True Shot"/>
6. Swap to Greatsword
7. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
8. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>




**Step 4: Additional Greatsword Skills**

<Skill name="bindingblade" /> (GS5) and <Skill name="leapoffaith" /> (GS3) can add additional damage or utility depending on the context.
- <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> fires projectiles at up to 5 nearby enemies. The skill can be recast to pull in hit enemies, or to deal breakbar damage to bosses.
- If standing inside a boss' hitbox, additional projectiles from <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> will all hit the boss, dealing massive single-target damage.
- <Skill name="leapoffaith" /> can be saved for mobility in fights with movement.
- If no above situations apply, <Skill name="bindingblade" /> and <Skill name="leapoffaith" /> provide a moderate dps increase over autoattacking. Weave them in after <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> and <Skill name="whirlingwrath" />.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/>
4. <Skill name="Hunter's Ward"/>
5. <Skill name="True Shot"/>
6. Swap to Greatsword
7. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
8. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
9. <Skill name="leapoffaith" />
10. <Skill name="bindingblade" />

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you will have the general concept down. Additional tips can be found on the advanced page if you wish to improve further.

For now, try to:

- Employ weapon swap in fights with long phases, usually after using <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>/<Skill name="True Shot"/> twice on their respective weapon sets.
- Make use of your CC skills to break boss bars faster
- Start thinking about phase times and how to fit the maximum amount of damage in before the boss dies/goes invulnerable

<Divider text="Underwater combat"/>

It is very much recommended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> since it provides much better DPS underwater compared to <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/>. If you still want to play <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> for whatever reason follow these rough guidelines.

- Open with <Skill name="refraction"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/>
- Cast <Skill name="purify"/> and swap to spear. Camp spear now.
- Priority list:
  1.  <Skill name="Zealots flurry"/> (Spear 2)
  2.  <Skill name="Symbol of spears"/> (Spear 4)
  3.  <Skill name="brilliance"/> (Spear 3)

<Divider text="Further precasts"/>

<Warning> 
The following tips are heavily tailored to static groups looking to push their damage, and are not recommended for pug scenarios. 
</Warning>

<Card title="Pretraps">

Before precasting boons at the Mistlock Singularity, you can precast traps on the boss or at add spawn locations for additional damage.


- You may want to skip <Skill name="purification" /> so that you can precast <Trait name="healersresolution" /> at the mistlock.
- If you status reset yourself (i.e. swap to a template with different traits), all of your traps (plus boons/buffs) will disappear.
- If <Skill name="processionofblades" /> or <Skill name="lightsjudgment" /> are swapped off of your utility bar, they will disappear even without status reset.

</Card>

<Card title="Presymbols">
Right before the boss is triggered, cast multiple symbols by cycling through weapons in your inventory. These will tick on the boss for additional burst damage. 

The available symbols for precasting are as follows: <Skill name="symboloffaith" />, <Skill name="symbolofswiftness" />, <Skill name="symbolofpunishment" />,  <Skill name="symbolofblades" />, <Skill name="symbolofenergy" />, <Skill name="symbolofresolution" />.

- <Skill name="symboloffaith" /> has the longest cast time and drops at your location at the end of the cast, so it is recommended to start with this while running in.
- Add <Skill name="shieldofwrath" /> in towards the end of your presymbols for significant extra damage. This may be difficult to do without a dedicated equipment template as equipping a 2-handed weapon will unequip your Focus.
- It is important to trigger the boss right after you finish presymboling, or you will lose damage ticks on your symbols.
- Instant CC is valuable so that presymbols tick into <Effect name="Exposed" />.
- In fast phase times, it can be worth it to use <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> and/or <Skill name="symbolofenergy" /> in your precast. With slower phases, it may be better to use them in-phase so that no ticks are missed.


Here is a sample presymbol skill order:
1. <Skill name="symboloffaith" /> while running in
2. <Skill name="symbolofswiftness" />
3. <Skill name="symbolofpunishment" /> and <Skill name="shieldofwrath" />
4. Swap to main weapon and trigger boss

You may wish to add/remove symbols to your precast depending on personal speed or boon/buff timers (such as <Skill name="onewolfpack" />). Do note that it is not worth casting 6 symbols as your oldest symbol will have expired by the time the boss is vulnerable.


- It can be useful to create dedicated templates for presymbols and pretraps. Take care not to status reset by swapping between build templates with different traits - only different utilities are okay.
- Do not presymbol in pugs unless you are absolutely sure no one else will trigger the boss before you, or you will have to learn to play Mace <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" />.

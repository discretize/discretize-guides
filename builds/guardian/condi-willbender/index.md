The <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Condi Willbender"/> is a strong build with high damage, very strong CC, great mobility, and a forgiving rotation, making it a strong choice for all groups. It can also easily slot more supportive utility skills allowing you to provide <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, reflects and more to yourself and your party.
 
Compared to the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Firebrand"/>, this build has even greater self-sustain and can provide a large amount of <Boon name="Might" /> for itself if needed by taking <Trait name="holyreckoning" />. It can also provide more CC due to <Skill name="heavenspalm" />. However, it lacks the utility the Tomes can provide as well as the option to bring a significant amount of <Boon name="Quickness" />.

<Information>

Although this build lists 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

Many different gear variations can be run on this build that varies damage-wise in certain situations. Overall when considering <Effect name="Exposed"/> and the fact you can share gear with <Specialization name="Firebrand" text ="Condi Firebrand"/> makes the setup below the best option for fractals. If you want to optimize for different situations you can use our [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/).

The 3rd utility skill slot is flexible. Look at the Situational Skills below for common options.

This build also makes use of a <Item id="96613"/> gaining <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> from <Trait name="Power of the Virtuous"/>. Removing this does not change the gear!

You will want the following weapons to swap to during fractal runs:

- Greatsword for pulling adds in Nightmare CM after MAMA and some T4s
- A staff for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking.
- Greatsword can also be run as an alternative to Sword offering extra cleave and a useful leap

### Skill Priority

In general, for fractals, there is no set rotation for <Specialization name="Willbender" text="Condi Willbender"/>. Instead, you want to adapt your rotation depending on phase length and cooldowns. You can use the skill priority list below to see what your most important skills are. Make sure to prioritise using <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/> to maintain <Skill id="62618"/> and aim for maximum uptime of <Trait name="lethal tempo"/>.

In either off-hand weapon, you want to trigger <Skill name="Hail of Justice"/> or <Skill name="Zealot's Fire"/> three times then swap.

1. <Skill name="Rushing Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Purging Flames"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Ignition"/>
4. <Skill name="Peacekeeper"/>
5. <Skill name="Whirling Light"/> off cooldown
6. <Skill name="Flowing Resolve"/> off cooldown
7. <Skill name="Crashing Courage"/> off cooldown

#### Off-hand pistol
<Skill name="Hail of Justice"/>
#### Off-hand torch
<Skill name="Zealot's Flame"/> and <Skill name="Zealot's Fire"/> when you have a charge

<Card title="Precasting">

1.  Use <Skill name="hallowedground"/>
2.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="holystrike"/> and/or <Skill name="Hammer of Wisdom"/>
3.  Take the _Mistlock Singularity_

You can also precast stacks of <Trait name="lethal tempo"/> using your virtue skills, but this can be tricky due to them being movement abilities.

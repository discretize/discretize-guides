<Advanced>

The <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is currently the strongest power build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals.

You'll provide boon removal through <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/> as well as Sword auto-attack chains when playing the Sword/Focus variant.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized. This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

For fractals, due to <Effect name="Exposed"/>, it is worth adjusting the build to make use of <Item id="24868"/>. An important advantage of having an impact sigil setup is also that it allows for easy sigil swapping. This is relevant because on Dark AI <Item id="36053"/> and on Siax as well as Ensolyss <Item id="24658"/> provide even better damage boosts. <Item id="36053"/> also works on several strike missions. Furthermore, <Item id="24575"/> can be used on some raid encounters and in open world. Hence, if you do not own a build already, across all content, the impact sigil setup will provide you higher damage and greater flexibility. It is smarter to also play the impact build in raids than the accuracy build in fractals. 

Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more gear variants!

Note: This setup assumes you use stat infusions. If you do not use stat infusions, <Item id="82791"/> is a damage increase. Additionally, if you want to optimise further, stats and runes will change using different combinations of <Item id="91805"/>, <Item id="43360"/>, <Item id="9443"/>, <Item id="50082"/> and <Item id="73191"/>! The difference is negligibly small though. Two impact gear sets are mostly included because the eagle setup uses fewer precise infusions while the potion setup keeps deadeye runes. Choose whatever is more convenient.

<Beginner>

The <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is currently the strongest power build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals. It can bring a decent amount of CC while offering good burst damage and great sustained DPS, as well as being able to adapt to bring a ton of extra utility such as <Boon name="Stability"/> or a reflect from the <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> toolkit.

The beginner version of the guide will focus on the most important utility options and try to teach the Greatsword version of the build which has a good amount of extra burst while also having notes for the Sword/Focus variant which can be useful for slightly more sustained damage and nice utility through <Skill name="Temporal Curtain"/>.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> has to offer. Once you can execute the step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it and are confident with the utility options provided here, head over and check out the advanced page for some extra information. Feel free to swap to the advanced page early if you feel like you are missing some information on additional (less common) utility skills or trait swaps.

For fractals, due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> it is worth adjusting the build to make use of <Item id="24868"/>. However, if you do not want to use multiple builds for different content, the sometimes suggested raid build using <Item id="24618"/> is also okay to run. If you don't own a build already, it is smarter to bring the impact sigil build to raids than the accuracy sigil build to fractals.

### Extra Weapons

- You can run Sword/Focus instead of Greatsword. This variant is very useful to use in T4 fractals to pull groups of enemies together with <Skill name="Temporal Curtain"/> to cleave them down more easily.

<Warning>

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

It's important to note that phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

### Step by Step Beginner Rotation

**Step 1: Opener**

We'll start with the basic dagger/sword opener.

1. Start on Dagger/Sword and use <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>,<Skill name="Bladecall"/>,<Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>, then swap to Greatsword.

**Step 2: Signet of Ether**

Next ,we will start with the basic loops. This is the backbone of the rotation and practicing this part for a bit will get you set up well for almost the rest of the rotation.

1. Do Step 1.
2. Use <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> -> <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/>.
3. Reset your cooldowns with <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/> and cast <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> -> <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/>.
4. Wait on Greatsword until you can cast one more <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>, then swap to Dagger/Sword.
5. Use <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> right away.
6. Wait for <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> and then swap back to Greatsword.
7. Repeat from Step 2.

**Step 3: Weapon Skills**

In Step 3, we will incorporate other Weapon Skills. We will add multiple skills at once so take your time if you feel like you struggle with this.

1. Do Step 1.
2. Do <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> -> <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> -> <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/> from Step 2.
3. Use <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> -> <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> -> <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>.
4. Wait until <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/> off cooldown and cast it
5. End your Greatsword loop with <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> -> <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> -> <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
6. Weapon Swap
7. Start you Dagger/Sword loop with <Skill name="Unstable bladestorm"/> -> <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> -> <Skill name="Bladecall"/>.
8. Wait until <Skill name="Bladecall"/> off cooldown and cast it
9. End your Dagger/Sword loop with <Skill name="Unstable bladestorm"/> -> <Skill name="Bladecall"/> -> <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>

**Step 4: F1 Shatter**

In Step 3, we will incorporate other Weapon Skills. We will add multiple skills at once so take your time if you feel like you struggle with this.

Next, we will incorporate our F1 Shatter <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/>.

- Use it only when you have 5 Blades stocked.
- Use it for the first time after your initial <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>.
- Use it off-cooldown but only with 5 Blades afterward and after weapons skills.
- Example of use on Greatsword Loop <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> -> <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> -> <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/> -> <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/>
- Example of use on Dagger/Sword Loop <Skill name="Unstable bladestorm"/> -> <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> -> <Skill name="Bladecall"/> -> <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/>.

**Step 5: Utility Skills**

Lastly, we will add the remaining Utility Skills to the rotation.

- Cast <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/> at the start of the fight and then use it off-cooldown.
- Cast <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> off-cooldown as well. This skill is an instant cast and can therefore be used while casting other skills.

</Beginner>

<Advanced>
### SKill Priority

To play <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> in fractals you need to adapt on the go as phantasms are slower than skills from other classes.

If you lose yourself in the rotation follow this priority list.

1.  Cast your phantasms whenever ready.
    - <Skill id="10174"/>
    - <Skill id="10267"/>
    - <Skill id="10221"/>
2.  Use <Skill id="21750"/> to recharge them all.
3.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> with 5 Blades as much as possible. Only delay it for <Effect name="Exposed"/> but remember that it also grants you a 5% damage buff through <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/>.
4.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Sorrow"/> for damage and to keep up the buff from <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/>. Make sure to prioritize having 5 Blades for <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> though. Situationally you can use this with 5 Blades such as in your burst rotation or when a phase is about to end and <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> is on cooldown.
5.  <Skill id="62553"/> deals damage over time so make sure to cast it at the start of phases. If a boss is close to phasing, save it for the start of the next phase.
6.  Use <Skill id="62560"/>, <Skill id="62607"/>, <Skill id="10333"/> and <Skill id="10218"/> off recharge.

- <Skill name="Illusionary Riposte"/> is a DPS increase if you time it well, and don't interrupt other casts.

Remember that your personal damage skills are faster than phantasms, but that they deal more damage over time, this means that direct damaging skills such as <Skill id="62560"/> and auto-attacks get higher priority if the boss is close to phasing.

Utilize <Skill name="Bladesong Dissonance"/> for CC, but also remember to not use too much CC on the break bar and space out your big CC cooldowns like <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> so they don't overlap with other powerful CC skills.

Apart from doing DPS, you'll also have access to a wide range of utilities which can all be used for skips, blocks, and damage mitigation. Make sure to read what they do and don't be afraid to swap to them situationally, especially in T4s.

### Opener

There is a basic fractal opener, you will need to adapt this depending on the boss and cooldowns.

- Start on Sword

1. <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/>
2. <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>
3. <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>
4. <Skill name="Bladecall"/>
5. _Weapon Swap_
6. <Skill name="Bladesong Dissonance"/>
7. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
8. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/>
9. <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>
10. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
11. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/>
12. <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/>
13. <Skill name="Mirror blade"/>
14. <Skill name="Mind Stab"/>
15. <Skill name="Bladesong Sorrow"/>

<Card title="Precasting">

At the Mistlock Singularity

- Make sure to start with 5 Blades. If you need use <Skill name="Blade Renewal"/> to replenish them.

1. Blast fire fields with <Skill name="The Prestige"/>.
2. Use <Skill name="Inspiring Imagery"/> (Careful its Ethereal Combo Field)
3. Extend boons with <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/> if you have time.
4. Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity when your group is done pre-buffing.
5. Additionally you can precast a <Skill name="Time Warp"/> on the boss and take the singularity as well on bosses like Skorvald, or any boss if you use portals.

At the boss (spawnable bosses)

1. Cast <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/>. Skip this step if you did not use <Skill name="Mimic"/> at the singularity.
2. You can precast <Skill name="The Prestige"/> and <Skill name="Chaos Storm"/> to squeeze out a little more burst, if your group coordinates.
3. Cast <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/> (again).
4. Start casting <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> if the boss starts with a break bar.

At the boss (pre spawned bosses)

- You can also precast <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/>.

### Golem Rotation

This video shows the full rotation for the Greatsword variant on the golem.

<Video caption="by beng / L3m0n" youtube="DpBnvYF9ZnE"/>

<Beginner>

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far.

The additional steps are:

- Use other Shatter skills (F2/F3) for extra damage and to keep up the buff from <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/>. Make sure to always have 5 Blades back for when your <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> comes back.
- Precast additional skills before the encounter starts to get a bigger spike of damage at the start of the fight.

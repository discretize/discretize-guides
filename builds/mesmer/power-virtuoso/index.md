The <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is the strongest power build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals.

You'll provide boon removal through <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/> as well as Sword auto-attack chains when playing the Focus/Pistol variant.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized. This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

You can go this Illusions variant over the Domination traitline when you're facing <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime issues to be more self-sufficient in bad groups, if you're also lacking <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> consider going <Trait name="Persistence of Memory" size="small"/> as well.

<Traits traits1="Mirage" traits1Selected="Elusive Mind" unembossed/>

Utilize Mirage for skips!

<p>
<Trait name="Elusive Mind"/>, <Skill name="Jaunt"/> and <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> along with the typical Mesmer toolset makes it really good for mobility and skips.

Situationally used for <Skill name="Continuum Split"/>, which can be useful when stealthing your group with <Skill name="Mass Invisibility"/> or any utility you want to use twice. Additionally allows for shield to be equipped giving you a very strong block with <Skill id="30769"/> and <Skill id="29649"/>. In niche cases can be used for some self <Boon name="alacrity"/> through <Trait name="Flow of Time"/> and <Trait name="Improved Alacrity"/>.

<Card title="Skill priority">

To play <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> in fractals you need to adapt on the go as phantasms are slower than skills from other classes.

If you lose yourself in the rotation follow this priority list.

1.  Cast your phantasms whenever ready.
    - <Skill id="10174"/>
    - <Skill id="10267"/>
    - <Skill id="10221"/>
2.  Use <Skill id="21750"/> to recharge them all.
3.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> with 5 Blades as much as possible. Only delay it for <Effect name="Exposed"/> but remember that it also grants you a 5% damage buff through <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/>.
4.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Sorrow"/> for damage and to keep up the buff from <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/>. Make sure to prioritize having 5 Blades for <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> though. Situationally you can use this with 5 Blades such as in your burst rotation or when a phase is about to end and <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> is on cooldown.
5. <Skill id="62553"/> deals damage over time so make sure to cast it at the start of phases. If a boss is close to phasing, save it for the start of the next phase.   
6. Use <Skill id="62560"/>, <Skill id="62607"/>, <Skill id="10333"/> and <Skill id="10218"/> off recharge.
- <Skill name="Illusionary Riposte"/> is a DPS increase if you time it well, and don't interrupt other casts.

Remember that your personal damage skills are faster than phantasms, but that they deal more damage over time, this means that direct damageing skills such as <Skill id="62560"/> and auto-attacks get higher priority if the boss is close to phasing.

Utilize <Skill name="Bladesong Dissonance"/> for CC, but also remember to not use too much CC on the breakbar and space out your big CC cooldowns like <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> so they don't overlap with other powerful CC skills.

Apart from doing DPS, you'll also have access to a wide range of utilities which can all be used for skips, blocks and damage mitigation. Make sure to read what they do and dont be afraid to swap to them situationally, ecpecially in T4s.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

It's important to note that phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers, unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

<Card title="Precasting">

At the Mistlock Singularity

- Make sure to start with 5 Blades. If you need use <Skill name="Blade Renewal"/> to replenish them.
1. Blast fire fields with <Skill name="The Prestige"/>.
2. Extend boons with <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/> if you have time.
3. Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity when your group is done pre-buffing.
4. Additionally you can precast a <Skill name="Time Warp"/> on the boss and take the singularity as well on bosses like Skorvald, or any boss if you use portals.

At the boss (spawnable bosses)

1. Cast <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/>. Skip this step if you did not use <Skill name="Mimic"/> at the singularity.
2. You can precast <Skill name="The Prestige"/> and <Skill name="Chaos Storm"/> to squeeze out a little more burst, if your group coordinates.
3. Cast <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/> (again).
4. Start casting <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> if the boss starts with a breakbar.

At the boss (prespawned bosses)

- You can also precast <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/>.

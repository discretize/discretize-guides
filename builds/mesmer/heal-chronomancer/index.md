<Warning>  
 
This build is made for PuGs environments. More info about building effective team compositions can be found [here](/guides/teamcomp101/). It provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing and therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. Once the safety of a dedicated healer is no longer needed, you can move on to running e.g. [Power Boon Chronomancer](/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer/) and other alternative boon providing build options.    
    
</Warning>         

The <Specialization name="Chronomancer" text="Heal Boon Chronomancer"/> is able to provide permanently up to  25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, either <Boon name="Quickness"/> or <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Vigor"/> and a majority of the required <Boon name="Swiftness"/> uptime. It also has on-demand access to <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Resistance"/>. The build is very flexible and can be adapted to the encounter, instabilities, and the group you are playing with. Make sure to read through the situational tab for an explanation of the different utility skills. 

It offers a great amount of healing through Clone related traits like <Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Illusions"/>, Wells via <Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Mantras"/>. As well as providing boon removal in order to deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>. It also has great utility for T4 fractals, with pulls through <Skill name="Temporal Curtain"/>, and access to <Effect name="Stealth"/>, <Effect name="Superspeed"/>, and leaps such as <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> for skips.

Note that this build variant is optimized for 150 agony resistance (utilising the additional 250  concentration of <Trait name="Chaotic Persistence"/>), with enough <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> to maintain boons. Celestial is chosen due to it providing more than enough <Attribute name="Healing Power"/> for T4 and CM fractals, while also increasing your personal damage to make mechanics like the Aspects on Silent Surf.

<Item id="99965"/> adds some <Effect name="Barrier"/> to the toolkit and has great synergy with <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> and the corresponding traits. Alternatively if you feel like your party needs more healing take <Item id="100031"/>. 

If you want to use one gear setup for other types of instanced content we reccomend using the [Raid/Strike](https://snowcrows.com/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/heal-boon-chronomancer) setup, due to not having the extra attributes from <Item id="79722" text="Fractal Potions"/> outside of Fractals. 

Check the Skill Explanations section below for alternative weapon setups. If you don't have the Weaponmaster Training mastery, take Staff in place of Rifle.

If you are struggling to maintain boons, check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more gear variants!

#### Traits for Skips
While we don't recommend leaving your party during boss fights, when dealing with sections of trash mobs, <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> has fantastic utility to speed these sections up, often allowing your party to ignore sectrions of some fractals entirely, using Blinks, <Effect name="Stealth"/>, and <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. Some traits you will find useful for this are:
- <Trait name="Temporal Enchanter"/> - This will let you provide <Effect name="Superspeed"/> to yourself and your party.
- <Trait name="Prismatic Understanding"/> - This will increase the duration of <Effect name="Stealth"/> gained from skills such as <Skill name="Mass Invisibility"/> and <Skill name="Veil"/>.
- Utilize Mirage for skips when moving across large distances or you need leaps! <Trait name="Elusive Mind"/>, <Skill name="Jaunt"/> and <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> along with the typical Mesmer toolset makes it really good for mobility and skips.

### Boonstrip
#### No Pain, No Gain
When boonstrip is required on single targets the simplist option is to use <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/>. <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> has a 20 second internal cooldown so the <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> will always be availible to use. Be careful during split phases, since the timer for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> keeps ticking, meaning that if you cant strip every 20 seconds, you may find yourself desynced.

Another option is to play <Item id="72872"/> which can free up a utility slot, however it will only strip boons if the boss is casting an attack or has a defiance bar up.

#### T4s
On certain T4s, mainly dredge fractals such as molton boss where the majority of trash mobs have a large amount of boons, it is also recommended to play <Item id="72872"/>. This in combination with skills such as <Skill name="Well of Senility"/> and <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> can help to strip boons from multiple mobs at once. <Skill name="Null Field"/> is another option to strip boons from multiple mobs at once.

</GridItem>
</Grid>


<Divider text="Skill usage"/> 

To play <Specialization text="Heal Boon Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> you'll want to be constantly generating clones.

Clone generation gets covered by a number of skill. On Scepter, the third hit of your Scepter attack chain <Skill name="Ether Clone"/> and double casting of <Skill name="Illusionary Counter"/> (Scepter 2) will both generate one clone each. Casting <Skill name="Illusionary Counter"/> (Scepter 2) and blocking an attack will generate 2 clones. On Staff, <Skill name="Phase Retreat"/> (Staff 2) will also generate a clone, however it also will teleport you back, away from the party.  Using a healing skill will generate a clone through <Trait name="Ego Restoration"/>.

Additionally, illusions summoned from <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/> (Staff 3) and <Skill name="Echo of Memory"/> (Shield 4) will turn into clones after finishing their attacks. Therefore you want to be using these skills to generate illusions and clones as often as possible to try and maintain three clones and generate them as quickly as possible after using Shatter skills. 

Outside of Phantasms, <Skill name="Inspiring Imagery"/> or <Skill name="Well of Action"/> grants up to a third of your <Boon name="Might"/> application and <Boon name="Fury"/> if used off cooldown (be careful with well, since the boons are applied after a three second delay). <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> can be aligned with defiance breaks, but remember to use it in your rotation, to help maintain <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>. <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> can also be taken to help maintain <Boon name="Might"/> if you find yourself reponsible for all 25 stacks.

### Shatters
Clones can then be used to improve the effects of Shatters, to trigger:
- <Trait name="Seize the Moment"/> to provide <Boon name="Quickness"/>, or <Trait name="Stretched Time"/> (which makes <Trait name="Flow of Time"/> affect allies) to provide <Boon name="Alacrity"/>
- <Trait name="Illusionary Defense"/> for <Boon name="Protection"/>
- <Trait name="Bountiful Disillusionment"/> which generates <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, and <Boon name="Vigor"/>
- <Trait name="Illusionary Membrane"/> amd <Trait name="Chaotic Transference"/> which generate <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Swiftness"/>, and <Boon name="Protection"/>

<Skill name="Split Second"/> and <Skill name="Rewinder"/> should be used off cooldown, 
ideally with 3 active Clones.

The same can be applied to <Skill name="Time Sink"/>, although it should be saved for CC if you are due a defiance bar.

<Skill name="Distortion"/> should be held for emergency <Boon name="Stability"/>/<Boon name="Aegis"/>.

### Continuum Split
Entering <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> gives you a free cast of any of your availible skills. When it ends you will be reverted back to the position where you entered with your skill cooldowns also reverted. The duration of <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> depends on the amount of Clones spent.

If the last stack of one of your Mantras gets used during the Continuum Split, the skill will not be reverted and need to be channeled again!

Use **all** Shatters while in <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> for additional boons.

<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> gets the most value at boon precasts, and during combat, if you either need additional CC, <Boon name="Stability"/>/<Boon name="Aegis"/>, or burst heal.

<Divider text="Situational Boons"/>
<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">

### Stability
- Correct application of <Boon name="Stability"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which attacks and be negated with <Boon name="Stability"/> without taking too much damage.
- <Skill name="Mantra of Concentration"/> is your main tool and grants 4 stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> after the initial channel and 3 stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> for each of the two remaining casts. If a phase requires <Boon name="Stability"/> right at the start, it makes sense to precast the channeled version e.g. Arkk.
- <Skill name="Distortion"/> share 3 stacks of <Boon name="Stability"/> through <Trait name="Bountiful Disillusionment"/> and should be used as a backup source, while at least one instance of <Skill name="Mantra of Concentration"/> is recharging.
- Any Shatter with <Trait name="Bountiful Disillusionment"/> will grant you 1 stack of personal <Boon name="Stability"/>

### Aegis

- Correct application of <Boon name="Aegis"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which attacks are impactful to block.

- <Skill name="Well of Precognition"/> provides one stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/> at the initial cast and on every follow up pulse. Your best choice for multiple incomming hits at a short period of time e.g. some MAMA patterns and Siaxs Volatile Hallucinations.

- <Skill name="Distortion"/> immediately grants one stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/> via <Trait name="Inspiring Distortion"/>. A great emergency skill.

- <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/> (or any other Signet) grants one stack of <Boon name="Aegis"/> via <Trait name="Inspiring Distortion"/>, when <Trait name="Blurred Inscriptions"/> is traited. Play this instead of <Skill name="Well of Precognition"/>.   

### Resistance

- Correct application of <Boon name="Resistance"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which conditions can be temporarely negated by <Boon name="Resistance"/>. E.g. at some T4 fractals <Condition name="Immobile"/> can be ignored to activate multiple trigger points, as well as at encounters that bombard your group with <Condition name="Slow"/> and <Condition name="Chilled"/>.
- On Rifle <Skill name="Singularity Shot"/> applies <Boon name="Resistance"/> for a short duration.
- Any Glamour skill shares <Boon name="Resistance"/> through <Trait name="Temporal Enchanter"/>. Most of the time <Skill name="Feedback"/> is the preffered skill to do this.
- <Trait name="Mental Defense"/> shares <Boon name="Resistance"/> when <Skill name="Distortion"/> is used, at the cost of some healing and condition cleanse. In power compositions this can become crucial at Arstariiv, dealing with <Condition name="Weakness"/> applied. Since an optimised precast can fully cover the entire first phase.

### Healing and Condition Cleanse
One of your primary sources of healing is <Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/>,  Which heals allies and yourself for each Illusion and Clone summoned. If multiple Illusions or Clones are summoned at the same time, the trait triggers for each Phantasm. The trait also increases your outgoing healing.

Granting boons as described above, also helps through <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, which is also generated through <Trait name="Metaphysical Rejuvenation"/>, when you cast a heal skill.

Finally, <Trait name="Restorative Mantras"/> and <Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/> top it off, with most of your utility skill choices benefiting from these traits.

If you are playing with <Trait name="Restorative Illusions"/>, every shatter will heal your party, scaling on the amount of clones spent.

<Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/> can provide decent burst heal, if you manage your ressources wisely and the same applies to condition pressure, combined with <Skill name="Mantra of Resolve"/> or <Trait name="Sympathetic Visage"/>.

Consider playing <Skill name="Well of Eternity"/> for a large burst heal and condition cleanse. This is mostly useful in T4 fractals such as Sirens Reef, whith large amounts of damage and condition pressure.

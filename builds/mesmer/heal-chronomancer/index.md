<Warning> 

This build is made for PuGs environments. More info about building effective team compositions can be found [here](/guides/effective-comp). It provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing and therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. Once the safety of a dedicated healer is no longer needed, you can move on to running e.g. [Power Boon Chronomancer](/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer/) and other alternative boon providing build options. 
 
</Warning> 


The <Specialization name="Chronomancer" text="Heal Boon Chronomancer"/> is able to provide permanently up to  25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, either <Boon name="Quickness"/> or <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and a majority of the required <Boon name="Swiftness"/> uptime. It also has on-demand access to <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Resistance"/>.

The build is very flexible and can be adapted to the encounter, instabilities, and the group you are playing with. Make sure to read through the situational tab for an explanation of the different utility skills. 

It offers a great amount of healing through clone related traits like <Trait name="Illusionary Inspiration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Illusions"/>, Wells via <Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Trait name="Restorative Mantras"/>, etc.

You'll provide boon removal through <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> in order to deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>.

<Warning> 

This build has a great boon uptime as long as you can generate clones/phantasms and can struggles to provide long lasting boons during downtimes or precast scenarios. 

Compared to <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> we recommend to start playing <Specialization name="Chronomancer" text="Heal Boon Chronomancer"/> as an <Boon name="Alacrity"/> provider until you reached a certain level of depth build knowledge.

Note that this build variant is optimized for 150 agony resistance and providing yourself with permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> in order to achieve 100% boon duration (utilising the additional 250  concentration of <Trait name="Chaotic Persistence"/>. 

If you have more Agony Resistance, feel free to swap out gear for additional Minstrel stats.

<Item id="99965"/> adds some barrier to the toolkit and great synergy with <Skill name="Mantra of Recovery"/> and the corresponding traits.

In case you struggle to keep up <Boon name="Regeneration"/> or simply want to use your Raid setup, full Harrier can be played alternatively, loosing some <Attribute name="Healing Power"/> and a massive amount of <Attribute name="Vitality"/> & <Attribute name="Toughness"/>.

<Warning>  

Heal Chrono is supposed to be played in PuGs. More info about building effective team compositions can be found [here](/guides/effective-comp). This build provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing. It, therefore, shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. Once the safety of a dedicated healer is no longer needed, you can move on to running [Power Boon Chrono](/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer/) or swap to one of the alternative boon builds.

### Situational Traits

<Traits traits1="Illusions" traits1Selected="Shatter Storm,Phantasmal Haste,Phantasmal Force" unembossed/>

You can go play Illusions over Domination when you're facing <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime issues to be more self-sufficient in bad groups, if you're also lacking <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> consider going <Trait name="Persistence of Memory" size="small"/> as well.

<Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/> can be taken for additional group sustain.


Utilise <Specialization name="Mirage"/> for skips!

<Trait name="Elusive Mind"/>, <Skill name="Jaunt"/> and <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> along with the typical Mesmer toolset makes it really good for mobility and skips.

### Skill priority
To play <Specialization text="Power Alacrity Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in fractals you need to adapt on the go, as Phantasms/Wells are our main damage source, but also slower than most skills of other classes.

If you lose yourself in the rotation follow this priority list:

1.  On Greatsword <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> is your strongest skill and should be used of cooldown to be able to get three usages before swapping (utilising <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>).

2.  On Sword <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> follows the same principle.

3. You want to use your utility skills in the following priority:
  
   1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/>
   2. <Skill name="Well of Action"/>
   3. <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> (when no CC is required)
   4. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/>


4.  Ideally <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/> can be used three times and <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> twice. On Dagger/Sword you basically prioritise the same way, <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/> twice as well and <Skill name="Bladecall"/> three times.

4.  Only your Sword Auto-Attacks require you to finish a chain. Dagger would ideally not get interrupted within the single cast applications, while Greatsword deals consistent damage during its cast and therefor is supposed to get canceled as soon as one of the higher priority skills becomes available again.

If the boss gets close to phasing, remember that your personal damage skills are faster than Wells and Phantasms, but that they deal less damage over time, this means that you have to get a feeling for group dps, to be able to guess when it becomes suboptimal to cast any further skills of those.

</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="5">
### Shatters
Even though casting Phantasms already covers a large portion of the necessary Alacrity uptime, shatters take an important part as well thanks to <Trait name="Stretched Time"/>.

Most fractal encounters include downtimes in between their phases, which means that you would want to make use of as many Clones as possible, to build up spare uptime.

Make sure to cast <Skill name="Split Second"/> on cooldown and ensure to keep three Clones for this one, since it's your main damage Shatter.

As long as that requirement is matched you can freely use any spare Clones on <Skill name="Rewinder"/>; and <Skill name="Time Sink"/> (as long as there is no upcomming defiance break).

### Continuum Split
<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> rewinds all your skills back to the status they have been while entering.
The durations depends on the amount of Clones spent, but usually two Clones are the optimal amount.

Your goal should be to cast as many high priority skills during that time window, to be able to cast them twice as often as usual. 

Since your Shatters will get rewinded as well, you can shatter **all** of them for additional Alacrity.

### Information
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  

It's important to note that Phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

### Opener
Example with <Skill name="Continuum Split"/>:
- <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> would usually be your dps choice if there is no need for <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> or <Skill name="Well of Senility"/> 

- Start on Dagger/Sword

1. **Precast** finished
   1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> on <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" /> days without a defiance bar
   2. or <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> + <Skill name="Time Sink"/> if the boss has a defiance bar (strips NPNG as well)

1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>
1. <Skill name="Bladecall"/> -> Weapon Swap
1. <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
   1. <Skill name="Illusionary Wave"/> if the boss has a defiance bar 
 
1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> (<Skill name="Continuum Split"/>)
   1. <Skill name="Well of Action"/> (<Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/>)
   2. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> 
   3. <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>
   4. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> (<Skill name="Split Second"/>) + remaining shatters
   5. <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> -> <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/> (<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> ends)

1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> (<Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/>)
1. <Skill name="Well of Action"/>
1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
1. <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>
1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
1. <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
1. <Skill name="Mind Stab"/>
1. Weapon Swap
1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>
1. <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>
1. <Skill name="Bladecall"/>
2. remaining stacks of <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> 

</GridItem>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">
<Card title="Precasting">
At the Mistlock Singularity

- Blast fire fields with <Skill name="The Prestige"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> twice (<Skill name="Continuum Split"/>)
- Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the Singularity when your group is done pre-buffing.

At the boss

- Use <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> before your <Skill name="Mimic"/> timer runs out.
- As long as you are not already in combat cast <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> and swap to your combat set.
- Depending on the phase length and if CC is required, you can also precast <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> or <Skill name="Well of Senility"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>.

### Golem Rotation

<Video youtube="xeDj0uYBCYk" caption="by Tipcat"/>

### Rotation Adjustments
The Opener takes around 15s and <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> has 70s cooldown with permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. 

Now it is up to you to figure out how many usages you can get at a certain fractal encounter and which phases would even be long enough to recommend using it.

Oftentimes you won't even have access to all the skills that got used in the opener above, or maybe you still gonna have cooldown on your Weapon-Swap.

Based on that, another approach could be to by-pass phases with low ressources by duplicating the few options you've got.

Otherwise double-casting Wells only makes sense at 9s+. Therefor you could also precast them, skipping their cast times during the actual phase, while still taking advantage of most of the pulsing/final damage.

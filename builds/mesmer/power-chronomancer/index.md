 The <Specialization text="Power Alac Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> is currently the strongest build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals.

 It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/> and 8 up to 16 <Boon name="Might"/>. 
 
 Despite having longer ramp-up times compared to <Specialization text="Power Alac Renegade" name="Renegade"/>, it is strong for PuGs and gets suboptimal the faster groups gonna get, especially at Arstariiv due to the lack of <Boon name="Resistance"/>.  
 
To succeed as a <Specialization text="Power Alac Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in higher-end groups you'll need to be able to **adapt** your rotation and push the limits of your class.

You'll provide boon removal through a various range of options, especially by utilising <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/>.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals, which should be taken advantage of.

If necessary the build can bring its own <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> making it rather self sufficient.

This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

<Divider text="Equipment" />   

A Firework Relic instead of Thief will increase your personal target damage, but eventually trade of cleave damage on Skorvald/Arkk/MAMA. 

For PuGs we recommend to stick with Thief due to overall longer phase times.

### Weapons Choices

Always play Greatsword main-hand.

Dagger:

- strongest raw dps output
- ranged cleave damage

Sword:
- burst
- evade
- boon rip on your Auto-Attack chain
- 600 range leap onto a target

Shield:
- additional 8 group <Boon name="Might"/>

Pistol:
- highest CC option

Focus:
- 5 target pull
- projectile block


<Traits traits1Id="1" traits1="Dueling" traits1SelectedIds="701,708,692" traits2Id="10" traits2="Domination" traits2SelectedIds="686,713,681" traits3Id="40" traits3="Chronomancer" traits3SelectedIds="1995,1978,1942"/>

### Situational Traits

<Traits traits1="Illusions" traits1Selected="Shatter Storm,Phantasmal Haste,Phantasmal Force" unembossed/>

You can go play Illusions over Domination when you're facing <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime issues to be more self-sufficient in bad groups, if you're also lacking <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> consider going <Trait name="Persistence of Memory" size="small"/> as well.

<Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/> can be taken for additional group sustain.


Utilize Mirage for skips!

<Trait name="Elusive Mind"/>, <Skill name="Jaunt"/> and <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> along with the typical Mesmer toolset makes it really good for mobility and skips.

### Shatter
Even tho casting phantasms already covers a large portion of the necessary Alacrity uptime, shatters take an important part as well thanks to <Trait name="Stretched Time"/>.

Most fractal encounters include downtimes in between their phases, which means that you would want to make use of as many clones as possible, to build up spare uptime.

Make sure to cast <Skill name="Split Second"/> on cooldown and ensure to keep three clones for this one, since it's your main damage shatter.

As long as that requirment is matched you can freely use any spare clones on <Skill name="Rewinder"/>; and <Skill name="Time Sink"/> (as long as there is no upcomming defiance break).

### Continuum Split
<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> rewinds all your skills back to the status they have been while entering.
The durations depends on the amount of clones spent, but usually two clones are the optimal amount.

Your goal should be to cast as many high priority skills during that time window, to be able to cast them twice as ofthen as usual. 

Since your shatters will get rewinded as well, you can shatter **all** of them for additional Alacrity.

### Skill priority
To play <Specialization text="Power Alacrity Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in fractals you need to adapt on the go, as phantasms/wells are our main damage source, but also slower than most skills of other classes.

If you lose yourself in the rotation follow this priority list:

1.  On Greatsword <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> is your strongest skill and should be used of cooldown to be able to get three usages before swaping (utilizing <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>).

2.  On Sword <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> follows the same principle.

3. You want to use your utility skills in the following priority:
  
   1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/>
   2. <Skill name="Well of Action"/>
   3. <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> (when no cc is required)
   4. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/>


4.  Ideally <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/> can be used three times and <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> twice. On Dagger/Sword you basically prioritise the same way, <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/> twice as well and <Skill name="Bladecall"/> three times.

4.  Only your Sword Auto-Attacks require you to finish a chain. Dagger would ideally not get interrupted within the single cast applications, while Greatsword deals consistent damage during its cast and therefor is supposed to get canceled as soon as one of the higher priority skills becomes available again.

If the boss gets close to phasing, remember that your personal damage skills are faster than wells and phantasms, but that they deal less damage over time, this means that you have to get a feeling for group dps, to be able to guess when it becomes suboptimal to cast any further skills of those.

### Information
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  

It's important to note that phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

### Golem Rotation

<Video youtube="xeDj0uYBCYk" caption="by Tipcat"/>


### Precasting
At the Mistlock Singularity

- Blast fire fields with <Skill name="The Prestige"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> twice (<Skill name="Continuum Split"/>)
- Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity when your group is done pre-buffing.

At the boss

- Use <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> before your <Skill name="Mimic"/> timer runs out.
- As long as you are not already in combat cast <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> and swap to your combat set.
- Depending on the phase length and if cc is required, you can also precast <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> or <Skill name="Well of Senility"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>.

</GridItem>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">

### Opener
Example with <Skill name="Continuum Split"/>:
- <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> would usually be your dps choice if there is no need for <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> or <Skill name="Well of Senility"/> 

- Start on Dagger/Sword

1. **Precast** finished
   1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> on <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" /> days without a defiance bar
   2. or <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> + <Skill name="Time Sink"/> if the boss has a defiance bar (strips NPNG as well)

1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>
1. <Skill name="Bladecall"/> -> Weapon Swap
1. <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
   1. <Skill name="Illusionary Wave"/> if the boss has a defiance bar 
 
1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> (<Skill name="Continuum Split"/>)

### Rotation Adjustments
The Opener above takes ~15s and <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> has 70s Cooldown with permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. 

Now it is up to you to think about how many usages you can get at a certain fractal encounter and which phases would even be long enough to recommend using it.

Oftentimes you won't even have access to all the skills that got used in the Opener above, or maybe you still gonna have Cooldown on your Weapon-Swap.

Based on that, another approach could be to by-pass phases with low ressources by duplicating the few options you've got.

Otherwise double-casting Wells only makes sense at 9s+. Therefor you could also precast them, skipping their cast times during the actual phase, while still taking advantage of most of the pulsing/final damage.

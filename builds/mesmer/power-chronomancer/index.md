The <Specialization text="Power Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> is the strongest (and only) build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals. Despite having one of the highest benchmarks in the game, this build is not that great in fractals due to long rampup times which make it strong for PuGs and a suboptimal pick for faster groups. If necessary the build can bring its own <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> making it rather self sufficient. 

To succeed as a <Specialization text="Power Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in higher-end groups you'll need to be able to __adapt__ your rotation on the go and push the limits of your class, but even then you will probably be a hinderance for your group.

You'll provide boon removal through your clones, auto-attack chains, <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/>.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized.

This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

<Card title="Skill priority">
To play <Specialization text="Power Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in fractals you need to adapt on the go as phantasms are our main damage source but they are slower than  skills from other classes

If you lose yourself in the rotation follow this priority list.

1. Cast your phantasms whenever ready.
    * <Skill id="10174"/>
    * <Skill id="10267"/>
    * <Skill id="10282"/>
2. Use <Skill id="21750"/> to recharge them all.
3. Use <Skill name="Split Second"/> with three clones as much as possible only delay it for <Effect name="Exposed"/>
4. Use <Skill name="Rewinder"/> whenever you don't have any clones, situationally you can shatter it with three clones such as in your burst rotation or when a phase is about to end and <Skill name="Split Second"/> is on cooldown.
5. Use <Skill id="10334"/> and <Skill id="30525"/> (if used) off recharge.
* <Skill name="Illusionary Riposte"/> is a DpS increase if you time it well, and don't interrupt other casts.

Remember that your personal damage skills are faster than phantasms, but that they deal more damage over time, this means that <Skill name="Blurred Frenzy"/> and auto-attacks get higher priority if the boss is close to phasing.

Utilize <Skill name="Time Sink"/> for CC, but also remember to not use too much CC on the breakbar and space out your big CC cooldowns like <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> or <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> so they don't overlap with other powerful CC skills.


Apart from doing DPS, you'll also have access to a wide range of utilities which can all be used twice with <Skill id="29830"/> if needed. Cast <Skill id="10173"/> to quickly get up another illusion.

<Card title="Information">
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  
For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here. 

It's important to note that phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers, unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

<Card title="Precasting">
At the Mistlock Singularity

* Blast firefields with <Skill name="The Prestige"/>.
* Extend boons with <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/> if you have time.
* Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity when your group is done pre-buffing.
* Additionally you can precast a <Skill name="Time Warp"/> on the boss and take the singularity as well on bosses like Skorvald, or any boss if you use portals.
 

At the boss (spawnable bosses) 
* You can precast <Skill name="The Prestige"/>, <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> and <Skill name="Chaos Storm"/> to squeeze out a little more burst, if your group coordinates.


At the boss (prespawned bosses)

* Precast rotation. Start on Staff or Shield.

1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/>
2. <Skill name="Phase Retreat"/>
    2. Omit this step if <Skill name="Mimic"/> is precasted 

3. Swap to Greatsword from inventory
4. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
5. <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
6. Swap to Focus and proceed with the regular rotation
* If you start on Shield use <Skill name="Echo of Memory"/> before step 1.
* Precasting phantasms on MAMA is possible but the timing is trickier in PuGs as combat starts once your group hits the boss.

__Optional__

If you want to be more self-sufficient in fractals you can get a 100% boon duration set and take <Trait name="Bountiful disillusionment" size="small"/>.

Then enter <Skill name="Continuum split"/>, cast all shatters, exit <Skill name="Continuum split"/>, cast all shatters again and use <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/>. Precast <Skill  name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity.

Alternatively you can also precast <Skill name="Well of Recall"/> to help with <Boon name="Alacrity"/> uptime.

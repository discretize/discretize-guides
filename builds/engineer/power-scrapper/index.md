<Divider text="Gameplay"/>

<Specialization name="Scrapper" text="Power Scrapper"/> Has a priority based rotation, that is fairly fast paced. It also tries to ensure high uptime on several modifiers to increase its damage:
- <Item name="Relic of Fireworks"/> is gained for 6 seconds after hitting a weapon skill with 20+ seconds cooldown. See the list below.
- <Trait name="Object in Motion"/> is active while you have <Boon name="Swiftness"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/>, and <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. For each boon you have you will get a 5% multiplicative damage modifier.
- <Trait name="Modified Ammunition"/> Grants a 2% multiplicative damage modifer per condition on your foe. <Skill name="Grenade Kit"/> and <Skill name="Elite Mortar Kit"/> can be used to help with this, especially when precasting <Skill name="Elite Mortar Kit"/> in to a burst phase.
- <Trait name="Explosive Temper"/> gives a stacking <Attribute name="Ferocity"/> bonus up to 10 stacks when explosions hit your foe. 

Although <Specialization name="Scrapper" text="Scrapper"/> has a priority based rotation, there is one main skill combination you want to prioritise above all others and do almost off cooldown where possible, this is <Skill name="Electro Whirl"/> (Hammer 2) into <Skill name="Shrapnel Grenade"/> (<Skill name="Grenade Kit"/> 2, Utility Skill). At the start of phases try to follow the burst rotation below, where cooldowns are availible, and outside of this use the prioirty list below for filler skills. Additionally, make sure to try to maintain the uptime of the traits and Relic listed above to increase your damage as much as possible.

When playing <Specialization name="Scrapper" text="Quickness Scrapper"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> is generated through the trait <Trait name="Kinetic Accelerators"/>. Every time you perform a blast or leap finisher, you will share <Boon name="Quickness"/> to allies. Using the build at the top of the page, each finisher will share 4 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/>. Depending on the group and phase lengths, you may have to adjust your skills and rotation, to focus more on sharing <Boon name="Quickness"/>, and other times it may be enough to do a proper prestack, and just do the burst rotation. Also make sure you are ready to share quickness shortly before boss phases starts on CM fights, especially after periods of downtime, where other builds may want to precast some skills into the start of the phase.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>
<Warning>

Golem rotations from Raids are generally suboptimal in Fractals due to being optimized for sustained DPS. In Fractals players need to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase or specific burst windows like <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

### Burst Rotation

1.  <Skill name="Blast Gyro"/> (Utility)
2.  <Skill id="30713"/> (Hammer 5)
3.  <Skill name="Throw Mine"/> (Utility)
4.  <Skill name="Electro Whirl"/> (Hammer 2)
5.  <Skill name="Shrapnel Grenade"/> (<Skill name="Grenade Kit"/> 2)
6.  <Skill name="Grenade Barrage"/> (<Skill name="Grenade Kit"/> Toolbelt)
7.  <Skill name="Minefield"/> (<Skill name="Throw Mine"/> Toolbelt)
8.  <Skill name="Poison Grenade"/> (<Skill name="Grenade Kit"/> 5)
9.  <Skill name="Freeze Grenade"/> (<Skill name="Grenade Kit"/> 4)

### Skill Precasts
Skill precasts can be done on fights that you start out of combat. They are optional to do, however by succesfully hitting precast skills, you can massively increase your burst damage at the start of the fight. When <Specialization name="Engineer"/> casts a toolbelt skill, it can be swapped out without the new skill being on cooldown. Additionally, <Skill name="Throw Mine"/> and <Skill name="Minefield"/> can both be precasted before starting a fight, similar to trap skills on <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> or <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/>.
#### Basic Precast
This precast requires two build templates. A build template with precast skills, and one with your in fight skills. Having a countdown in voice when triggering bosses, or triggering them yourself will make this easier to do.

1.  <Skill name="Big Ol Bomb"/> (<Skill name="Bomb Kit"/> Toolbelt)
2.  <Skill name="Defense Field"/> (<Skill name="Bulwark Gyro"/> Toolbelt)
3.   _Swap to in-fight template_

#### Advanced Precast
This precast is only an option in organised groups. To be effective, you need to be able to cast these skills and pull the boss quickly to benefit, having someone count down in voice when triggering the boss is a good idea to make this consistent. It requires three equipment templates and two build templates! You will need an equipment template with <Item name="Relic of the Brawler"/>, another with <Item name="Relic of Cerus"/>, and finally your in fight template, as well as a build template with precast skills, and one with your in fight skills.

1.  <Skill name="Blast Gyro"/> (Utility)
2.  <Skill name="Big Ol Bomb"/> (<Skill name="Bomb Kit"/> Toolbelt)
3.  <Skill name="Reconstruction Field"/> (<Skill name="Medic Gyro"/> Toolbelt) to proc <Item name="Relic of the Brawler"/>
4.  <Skill name="Defense Field"/> (<Skill name="Bulwark Gyro"/> Toolbelt)
5.  <Skill name="Elite Mortar Kit"/> (Elite) to proc <Item name="Relic of Cerus"/>
6.  _Swap to in-fight template_

<Warning>

This build is very common in PuGs. It is currently the best heal build to use in PuGs. More info about this can be found [here](/guides/meta-explained). This build provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing. It therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities.

</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Alacrity Mechanist" /> provides permanent <Boon name="Might" />, <Boon name="Alacrity" />, <Boon name="Fury" />, <Boon name="Regeneration" /> and <Boon name="Vigor" />, as well as some <Boon name="Protection" />. It also has access to a small amount of <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability" /> througt <Skill id="63293"/>.

It offers a large of healing thanks to <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, <Skill name="Super Elixir"/>, permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Vigor"/> that you get from <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>. Whenever you use a Jade Golem skill it pumps out more healing when traited with <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/>. You can also provide a huge amount of <Effect name="barrier"/> with <Skill id="63141"/>, <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/> and <Skill name="Barrier Blast"/> maintaing a near permanant uptime on your party.

<Card title="Kits">

A large part of the support is generated through the use of your Jade Mech and Kits.

Engineering kits can be opened instantly to give acess to 5 new skills, which when closed again return you back to your weapon set. Each individual kit skill will have its own cooldown, although as you play the class you come to get a feel for when each skill will be availible.

<Skill name="Crash Down" text="Jade Mech"/>:

Your jade mech is your main source of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> generation, while also providing a significant portion of your other boons. It inherits your concentration and healing power thanks to <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>.

- <Skill name="Explosive Knuckle"/> and your Mechs auto attacks will slowly generate a small amount of might thanks to <Trait name="Mech Arms: High-Impact Drivers"/>.
- <Skill name="Crisis Zone"/> grants <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/> to 5 targets. It also is a condition cleanse and a stun break.
- <Skill name="Barrier Blast"/> pulses <Boon name="Might"/> abd <Boon name="Fury"/> to 5 targets resulting in 30 seconds of <Boon name="Might" text="15 Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> being shared. It also generates a large amount of <Effect name="Barrier"/> which in turn generates <Boon name="Alacrity"/> thanks to <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>.
- You can summon your Mech using <Skill name="Crash Down"/> and recall it with <Skill name="Recall Mech"/>
- Sometimes your Mech can get stuck, you can try to use _Return to Me_ to get it to come to you, if this doesnt work you may have to recall it instead.
- Remember your Mech commands will generate boons in a radius around your Mech. Make sure it is in range of you and your party before using them!

<Skill name="Med Kit"/>:

Your Med Kit is your main source of healing. It has a mixture of condi cleanse, supportive boon generation and burst healing thanks to <Trait name="Health Insurance"/>

- <Skill name="Med Blaster"/> and <Skill name="Bandage Blast"/> provide a large amount of constant healing to your party.
- <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> will cleanse up to 4 conditions over 3 seconds, while also providing a water field that can be used for blast heals.
- <Skill name="Vital Burst"/> is a large group heal that should be used to recover from high incoming damage.
- <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/> is a blast finisher that can be used to blast your water field from <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> for burst healing. It also provides some <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Vigor"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>.
- Remember that many skills in <Skill name="Med Kit"/> heal in a small radius so make sure you are close to your party.

<Skill name="Elixir Gun" />:

Provides some aditional support through condi cleanse, some burst healing and slow CC.

- <Skill name="Tranquilizer Dart"/> applies <Condition name="Weakness"/> for some slow CC.
- <Skill name="Glob Shot"/> applies <Condition name="Crippled"/> for some slow CC. When hitting an enemy it will also share <Boon name="Swiftness"/> to allies.
- <Skill name="Fumigate"/> is a mass condi cleanse, cleansing up to 5 conditions from allies. It also applies a small amount of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.
- <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/> is a blast finisher. Also since it is an Elixir it grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>
- <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> is a burst heal, Once hit it also creates an area of continual healing for 10 seconds, making this one of your best healing abilities. It also condi cleanses and grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>
- While not every skill in this kit is commonly used, in particular the condi cleanse and burst heal are very useful in high pressure situations.

<Skill name="Elite Mortar Kit"/>:

While not every skill is commonly used, it still provides some slow CC and has acess to a strong AoE pulsing heal.

- <Skill name="Endothermic Shell"/> applies a large amount of slow CC through <Condition name="Chilled"/>.
- <Skill name="Flash Shell"/> applies some slow cc through <Condition name="Blinded"/>.
- <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> is a strong AoE pulsing heal that can be used proactively before high pressure situations. It also grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>.

</Card>

<Divider text="Providing Boons"/>

<Card title="Standard Boons">

- <Boon name="Alacrity"/> is applied by two methods. The first is <Skill name="Crisis Zone"/>, which should be preseed off cooldown. In addition to this through the trait <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>, when you apply <Effect name="Barrier"/> you will also share <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. With high <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> it is very easy to upkeep 100% duration.
- <Boon name="Might"/> is mainly generated from <Skill name="Barrier Burst"/>, which will allow you to easily maintain 15 stacks. Outside of this you slowly generate <Boon name="Might"/> thanks to <Trait name="HGH"/>, which slowly will ramp might up to 25 stacks over time. If <Boon name="Might"/> is really suffering, you can also use utility skills such as <Skill name="Flame Turret"/> along with <Trait name="Experimental Turrets"/> to help.
- <Boon name="Fury" /> will be provided through pressing <Skill name="Barrier Burst"/> off cooldown. As long as you have at least 62.5% <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> you will be able to maintain 100% uptime.
- <Boon name="Swiftness"/> is provided mainly through <Skill name="Glob Shot"/> and <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- <Boon name="Regeneration"/> can be maintained permanantly by using <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/> off cooldown. When using <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, you also share it when using <Skill name="Bandage Blast"/> and <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- <Boon name="Protection"/> can be maintained permanantly by using <Skill name="Crisis Zone"/> off cooldown. Additionally using you Shield skills will also share some through <Trait name="Over SHield"/>.
- <Boon name="Stability"/> is lacking on <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Mechanist"/>, with <Skill name="Crisis Zone"/> providing 1 stack on a 24 second cooldown (with <Boon name="Alacrity"/>).
- <Boon name="Aegis"/> is lacking on <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Mechanist"/>, with <Skill name="Crisis Zone"/> providing 1 stack on a 24 second cooldown (with <Boon name="Alacrity"/>).
- <Boon name="Vigor"/> can be maintained permanantly by using <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/> off cooldown. When using <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, you also share it when using <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- <Effect name="Barrier"/> helps to provide <Boon name="Alacrity"/> through the trait <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>, while providing excellent damage mitigation. You have 3 main methods of generating <Effect name="Barrier"/>; <Trait name="Mech Core: Barrier Engine"/> passivley generates it over time, Your utility skills <Skill name="Barrier Burst"/> and <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/> and finally by using <Skill name="Barrier Blast" /> Your third auto attack skill on Mace.

</Card>

<Card title="Pre-Stacking Boons">

- To provide most of your boons, you can simiply cast <Skill name="Crisis Zone"/>, <Skill name="Barrier Burst"/> and <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>.
- If there is no fire field you can provide one with <Skill name="Napalm"/> (Skill 4) in <Skill name="Flamethrower"/>.
- To blast your firefield to share <Boon name="Might"/>, <Specialization name="Engineer"/> has blast finishers on many of its skills. Your most acessible blasts on <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Mechanist"/> are:
  - <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/> in <Skill name="Elixir Gun"/>
  - <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/> in <Skill name="Med Kit"/>
  - if you used <Skill name="Flamethrower"/> to provide a firefield, <Skill name="Flame Blast"/>
  - <Skill name="Magnetic Inversion"/>, the second activation of Shield 4.

</Card>

<Divider text="Healing"/>

<Card title="Sustained Healing">

- A large amount of your sustsined healing comes from traits. <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/>, <Trait name="Compounding Chemicals"/> and <Trait name="Backpack Regenerator"/> generate a lot of passive healing to yourself, which is then shared with <Trait name="Medical Dispersion Field"/> and amplified with <Trait name="Health Insurance"/>.
- When under constant pressure <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> and <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> can be used. It is reccomended to use <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> first due to its shorter cooldwon.
- If your parties hp is not full you can use <Skill name="Med Blaster"/> in <Skill name="Med Kit"/> which is very strong. However you should first consider other abilities to heal your party quicker, since you want to maximize your time on mace to generste <Effect name="Barrier"/>.
- Your best form of sustained healing is to keep your <Effect name="Barrier"/> uptime high. By using <Skill name="Barrier Blast"/>, <Skill name="Barrier Burst"/> and if needed <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/>, your party will not lose much health due to tanking damage.

</Card>

<Card title="Burst Healing">

- <Skill name="Vital Burst"/> and <Skill name="Bandage Blast"/> can be used for some burst healing.
- Aditionally you have 21 water fields with <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> and <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> which can then be blasted with <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/>, <Skill name="Magnetic Inversion"/> and <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/> for massive healing.
- If you dont have any burst healing abilities up, you can use <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/> for a large amount of <Effect name="Barrier"/> to help sustain your party while you heal them back up.
- If you are anticipating a large amount of incoming damage using <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> or <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> before for strong healing over time can be useful.

</Card>

<Card title="Condition Cleanse">

- Your strongest condition cleanse is <Skill name="Fumigate"/> in <Skill name="Elixir Gun"/>, removing up to 5 conditions on 5 targets.
- Blasting Light Fields also causes area condition cleanse. You can place light fields with <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> or <Skill name="Flash Shell"/> and then blast with <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/>, <Skill name="Magnetic Inversion"/> or <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- If you have a high amount of condition pressure you can use <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> or <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> for a longer lasting condition cleanse over time.

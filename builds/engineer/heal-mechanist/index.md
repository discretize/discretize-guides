It also has access to a small amount of <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability" /> througt <Skill id="63293"/>.

It offers a large of healing thanks to <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, <Skill name="Super Elixir"/>, permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Vigor"/> that you get from <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>.

A large part of the support is generated through the use of your Jade Mech and Kits.

Entering a Tome has a csat time and your Skill 5 on both weapon sets can cancel skill casts so make sure to not spam the 5 button when entering the Tome or you might end up cancelling the Tome.

Tomes also have the passive effect from the Virtues. Through <Trait name="Loremaster"/> those passive effects will be kept even if the Tomes are on cooldown.

<Skill name="Crash Down" text="Jade Mech"/>:

Your jade mech is your main source of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> generation, while also providing a significant portion of your other boons. It inherits your concentration and healing power thanks to <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>.
-  <Skill name="Explosive Knuckle"/> and your Mechs auto attacks will slowly generate a small amount of might thanks to <Trait name="Mech Arms: High-Impact Drivers"/>.

- <Skill name="Barrier Blast"/> pulses <Boon name="Might"/> abd <Boon name="Fury"/> to 5 targets resulting in 30 seconds of <Boon name="Might" text="15 Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> being shared. It also generates a large amount of <Effect name="Barrier"/> which in turn generates <Boon name="Alacrity"/> thanks to <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>.
- You can summon your Mech using <Skill name="Crash Down"/> and recall it with <Skill name="Recall Mech"/>
- Sometimes your Mech can get stuck, you can try to use _Return to Me_ to get it to come to you, if this doesnt work you may have to recall it instead.
- Remember your Mech commands will generate boons in a radius around your Mech. Make sure it is in range of you and your party before using them! 

<Skill name="Med Kit"/>:

Your Med Kit is your main source of healing. It has a mixture of condi cleanse, supportive boon generation and burst healing thanks to <Trait name="Health Insurance"/>
- <Skill name="Med Blaster"/> and <Skill name="Bandage Blast"/> provide a small amount of healing to your party
- <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> will cleanse up to 4 conditions over 3 seconds, while also providing a water field that can be used for blast heals.
- <Skill name="Vital Burst"/> is a large group heal that should be used to recover from high incoming damage.
- <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/> is a blast finisher that can be used to blast your water field from <Skill name="Vital Burst"/> for burst healing. It also provides some <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Vigor"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>.
- Remember that many skills in <Skill name="Med Kit"/> heal in a small radius so make sure you are close to your party.

<Skill name="Elixir Gun" />:

Provides some aditional support through condi cleanse, some burst healing and slow CC.
- <Skill name="Tranquilizer Dart"/> applies <Condition name="Weakness"/> for some slow CC.
- <Skill name="Glob Shot"/> applies <Condition name="Crippled"/> for some slow CC. When hitting an enemy it will also share <Boon name="Swiftness"/> to allies.
- <Skill name="Fumigate"/> is a mass condi cleanse, cleansing up to 5 conditions from allies. It also applies a small amount of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.
- <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/> is a blast finisher. Also since it is an Elixir it grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>
- <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> is a burst heal, Once hit it also creates an area of continual healing for 10 seconds, making this one of your best healing abilities. It also condi cleanses and grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>
- While not every skill in this kit is commonly used, in particular the condi cleanse and burst heal are very useful in high pressure situations.

<Skill name="Elite Mortar Kit"/>:

While not every skill is commonly used, it still provides some slow CC and has acess to a strong AoE pulsing heal.
- <Skill name="Endothermic Shell"/> applies a large amount of slow CC through <Condition name="Chilled"/>.
- <SKill name="Flash Shell"/> applies some slow cc through <Condition name="Blinded"/>.

</Card>

<Divider text="Providing Boons"/>

<Card title="Standard Boons">

- <Boon name="Quickness" /> will be provided by using <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" /> (which
  triggers <Trait name="Liberators Vow" /> every 7 seconds algning nicely with the recharge time of the skill with Alacrity and <Trait name="Weighty Terms"/>) and <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" />. You can use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> down to 0 charges whenever you are stacked with your group.
- <Boon name="Might" /> comes from different sources. <Skill name="Empower" /> is
  a big source of <Boon name="Might" /> and should be used off-cooldown whenever
  you are on Staff and on the group. Using <Skill name="Tome of Justice" /> Skill
  4 and blasting it with <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> will also grant <Boon name="Might" /> and
  give others the option to also blast additional <Boon name="Might" />. Using <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> as mentioned above will also contribute to <Boon name="Might" /> generation.
- <Boon name="Fury" /> will be provided through <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance" />
  . Make sure to use this off-cooldown when on the Axe weapon set while people are
  stacked together. Try to use this skill 2 times before swapping to Staff.
- <Boon name="Swiftness" /> mainly comes from <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" />
  . Make sure to use this whenever you are on Staff.
- <Boon name="Regeneration" /> will be provided through <Skill name="Mantra of Lore" /> when
  equipped. You can keep 2 charges for condi cleanse while providing some <Boon name="Regeneration" /> whenever it goes back to 3 charges.
- Your main source of <Boon name="Protection"/> comes from <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>. You can use it whenever you need it for healing but make sure to use it often enough to trigger <Trait name="Liberator's Vow"/> for <Boon name="Quickness"/>. Some <Boon name="Protection"/> can be provided through <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/>. <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> offers some <Boon name="Protection"/> from Skill 5 as well but you do not want to use this Tome just for a small boost in <Boon name="Protection"/>.
- <Boon name="Resolution" /> is provided through <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" /> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation" />. If you think you will not need all 3 charges for <Boon name="Stability" />, you can use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation" /> down to 2 charges in order to to keep up permanent <Boon name="Resolution" /> for the group alongside <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" />.

</Card>

<Card title="Pre-Stacking Boons">

- Provide a Fire Field if needed. <TomeSkill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/> in <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> provides a short Fire Field. <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> provides a longer Fire Field as well as extra <Boon name="Resolution"/> but has to be specifically slotted for pre-stacking.
- <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> to blast <Boon name="Might" />.
- <Skill name="Empower" /> and cast every equipped Mantra as often as you can during the cast.
- <Skill name="Feel My Wrath" /> if you have it equipped.
- <Skill name="Bane Signet" /> if you can start the fight within 10 seconds of usage.
- Take the singularity.
- <Skill name="Empower" /> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> once during
  this cast.
- <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" /> on the way to the boss and swap to Axe before
  the fight starts to place <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance" />.

</Card>

<Divider text="Healing"/>

<Card title="Sustained Healing">

- Try to keep your group alive as well as you can through sustained healing and use your burst healing only when it is needed. Keep in mind that active damage mitigation through avoiding attacks or blocking them is very valuable and will help a lot more than a slight increase in healing numbers.
- A lot of consistent healing comes from your symbols through <Trait name="Writ of Persistence"/>. Since you want to use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> off-cooldown anyways to provide boons, This will give you a nice amount of healing through the entire fight. Same goes for <Skill name="Empower"/>.
- Thanks to <Trait name="Selfless Daring"/> you will also heal at the end of a dodge roll. Make sure to keep enough endurance to avoid mechanics but otherwise feel free to use up dodges for healing.
- If <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> is equipped, it will provide <Boon name="Regeneration"/> to your group so make sure to use it down to 2 charges whenever it goes back up to 3.
- If Mace is equipped the auto-attacks will provide a good amount of healing and <Skill name="Symbol of Faith"/> will provide extra <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.

</Card>

<Card title="Burst Healing">

- For emergency situations you have some smaller burst healing options as well
  as your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />.
- If you are swapping to Staff when
  healing is needed keep in mind that <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" />
  provides healing over time while <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> and
  <Skill name="Empower" /> provide burst healing.
- <Skill name="Bow of Truth" /> is a great option for high burst healing when slotted.
- <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" /> is the biggest source of burst healing and should
  be used as a last resort due to its long cooldown. However due to the cast of both
  opening the Tome and the skills within, make sure to not hesitate too long. If
  the healing does not need to be immediate you can use 2-5-4-1-2, if you need the
  instant burst healing you can use 5-4-2-1-1.

</Card>

<Card title="Condition Cleanse">

- If a lot of condition cleanse is needed you will most likely slot <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> which will then be your main reliable source of condition cleanse while also providing some extra <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.
- Blasting Light Fields also causes area condition cleanse. On Staff you can place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.
- In <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" /> <TomeSkill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> and <TomeSkill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> will cleanse conditions as well,
  however same as with burst healing this is often a last resort. When running Virtues,
  opening this Tome will also cleanse conditions.

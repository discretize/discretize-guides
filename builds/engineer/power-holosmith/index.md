The <Specialization text="Power Holosmith" name="Holosmith"/> is a flexible build that can do well in a variety of different group compositions.
It offers:

- High burst and good sustained damage
- Good crowd control
- Good utility through <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and access to some <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Crippled"/> and <Condition name="Immobile"/>
- The ability to boonstrip with <Skill name="Detonate Mine Field"/> when running <Skill name="Throw Mine"/>
- An incredible skill set for various skips in Tier 4 fractals due to access to <Effect name="Stealth"/>, as well as <Effect name="Superspeed"/> and a targeted leap with <Skill name="Jump Shot"/>
- Some **self**-generation of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/>

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of slaying scarlets armies"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

There are 2 different versions of <Specialization text="Power Holosmith" name="Holosmith"/> which perform similarly, namely Sword ECSU, and Hammer PBM. They are named after:

- The weapon they are holding, Sword+Shield vs Hammer.
- The Grandmaster Holosmith Trait they use, Enhanced Capacity Storage Unit (ECSU) vs Photonic Blasting Module (PBM).

You will only need some Assassin pieces if you want to swap to <Trait name="Sanguine Array"/> for better self-generated <Boon name="Might"/>.

You can use Off-Hand Pistol if there is absolutely no need for the CC from Shield.

### Sword ECSU Rotation Explanation

- The idea of the opening is to stack as many damage modifiers as possible with your biggest skills. By entering Forge at the start, you will trigger <Trait name="Solar Focusing Lens"/>. Due to being in Forge, you will also gain the extra damage from <Trait name="Lasers Edge"/>. <Skill name="Grenade Barrage"/> will help with stacking <Trait name="Explosive Temper"/>.
- You want to always use your big damaging skills like <Skill name="Laser Disk"/> and <Skill name="Prime Light Beam"/> in Forge when possible. Only use them outside of Forge if the boss will die/phase before you can go back into Forge to use them there.
- In Forge, your high damage weapon skills are <Skill name="Corona Burst"/> and <Skill name="Photon Blitz"/>, as well as auto-attack chains. Try to not interrupt your Forge auto-attack chain. Your goal is to <Skill name="Deactivate Photon forge"/> at exactly 149 Heat. This can be achieved by using auto-attack chains until around 140 Heat (as seen in step 8), then using <Skill name="Corona Burst"/> and <Skill name="Deactivate Photon forge"/>. <Skill name="Corona Burst"/> will keep building up some Heat, however you cannot <Skill id="44386"/> if you already left Forge directly after its cast.
- Out of Forge, your basic rotation can be seen in steps 15-17. The main goal is to use <Skill name="Refraction Cutter"/> above 100 Heat 3 times. If you are slow, you might want to skip some extra skills like <Skill name="Poison Grenade"/> and <Skill name="Freeze Grenade"/> and prioritize <Skill name="Engage Photon Forge"/> at 90 Heat.

Extra notes:
- Use <Skill id="42163"/> off-cooldown. This skill can be used inside the hitbox when multiple enemies are around to hit the boss multiple times. If this can be done, for example on Ensolyss, you can delay this skill for that.
- <Skill id="5808"/> can be used to mitigate damage in add heavy fights.
- When running off-hand Pistol, <Skill name="Blowtorch"/> is used instead of <Skill name="Freeze Grenade"/> in step 20.
- When running off-hand Pistol, <Skill id="5830"/> can help in controlling the movement of enemies without break bar.
- Try to manage your Heat in split phases. Ideally, you always want to be back at 90 Heat when starting to burst into a new phase.
- <Skill name="Poison Grenade" profession="Engineer"/> will not always be up at the same step as its cooldown is higher than the duration of your loop. The general idea of using 2 extra damaging skills while cooling down still applies.

<Card title="Pre-Casting">

- Make sure that you will start the fight on your desired Heat (usually 90).
- You want to make sure to always at least pre-cast <Skill name="Laser Disk"/> before taking the singularity.
- You can either swap utility skills manually or via a template. Make sure to have the same traits in both templates selected if you choose the template route.
- If this is taken care of, you can do the following extra pre-casts:
  1. Equip <Skill name="Thumper Turret"/>, <Skill name="Bomb Kit"/> and <Skill name="Flamethrower"/>.
  2. Place <Skill name="Big Ol Bomb"/>.
  3. Use <Skill name="Fire Bomb"/> or <Skill name="Napalm"/> to provide a fire field.
  4. Use <Skill name="Rumble"/>, <Skill name="Flame Blast"/> and <Skill name="Magnetic Inversion"/> to blast.
  5. Use <Skill name="Incendiary Ammo"/>.
  6. Swap to your regular utilities and use <Skill name="Laser Disk"/>.
  7. Take the singularity.
- If you want to go the extra mile, you can keep the Flamethrower equipped and use <Skill name="Incendiary Ammo"/> again and place <Skill name="Napalm"/> on the boss spawn location before swapping it out.
- <Skill name="Holographic Shockwave"/> provides yet another blast finisher if it works with your Heat management.

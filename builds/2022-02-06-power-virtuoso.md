The <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is the strongest power build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals. You'll provide boon removal through your clones, auto-attack chains, <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/>.

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized. This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

<Card title="Skill priority">

To play <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> in fractals you need to adapt on the go as phantasms are our main damage source but they are slower than skills from other classes

If you lose yourself in the rotation follow this priority list.

1.  Cast your phantasms whenever ready.
    - <Skill id="10174"/>
    - <Skill id="10267"/>
    - <Skill id="10221"/>
2.  Use <Skill id="21750"/> to recharge them all.
3.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> with three clones as much as possible only delay it for <Effect name="Exposed"/>
4.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Sorrow"/> whenever you don't have any clones, situationally you can shatter it with three clones such as in your burst rotation or when a phase is about to end and <Skill name="Split Second"/> is on cooldown.
5. <Skill id="62553"/> deals damage over time so make sure to cast it at the start of phases. If a boss is close to phasing, save it for the start of the next phase.   
6. Use <Skill id="62560"/>, <Skill id="62607"/>, <Skill id="10333"/> and <Skill id="10218"/> off recharge.
- <Skill name="Illusionary Riposte"/> is a DPS increase if you time it well, and don't interrupt other casts.

Remember that your personal damage skills are faster than phantasms, but that they deal more damage over time, this means that direct damageing skills such as <Skill id="62560"/> and auto-attacks get higher priority if the boss is close to phasing.

Utilize <Skill name="Bladesong Dissonance"/> for CC, but also remember to not use too much CC on the breakbar and space out your big CC cooldowns like <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> so they don't overlap with other powerful CC skills.

Apart from doing DPS, you'll also have access to a wide range of utilities which can all be used for skips, blocks and damage mitigation. Make sure to read what they do and dont be afraid to swap to them situationally, ecpecially in T4s.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

It's important to note that phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers, unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

<Card title="Precasting">

At the Mistlock Singularity

- Blast fire fields with <Skill name="The Prestige"/>.
- Extend boons with <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/> if you have time.
- Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity when your group is done pre-buffing.
- Additionally you can precast a <Skill name="Time Warp"/> on the boss and take the singularity as well on bosses like Skorvald, or any boss if you use portals.

At the boss (spawnable bosses)

- You can precast <Skill name="The Prestige"/>, <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> and <Skill name="Chaos Storm"/> to squeeze out a little more burst, if your group coordinates.

At the boss (prespawned bosses)

- Precast rotation. Start on Staff.
1.  <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/>
2.  <Skill name="Phase Retreat"/>
    1.  Omit this step if <Skill name="Mimic"/> is precast
3.  Swap to Greatsword
4.  <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
5.  <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
6.  Swap to Sword and proceed with the regular rotation
- Precasting phantasms on MAMA is possible but the timing is trickier in PuGs as combat starts once your group hits the boss.

**Optional**

If you want to be more self-sufficient in fractals you can get a 100% boon duration set and take <Trait name="Bountiful disillusionment" size="small"/>.

Use <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/>. Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity.

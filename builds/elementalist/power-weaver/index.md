# Power Weaver (DPS)

The current optimal build for Elementalists in fractals is the <Specialization name="weaver"/>. It offers both the highest burst and consistent DPS in the game on large, stationary hitboxes and very good DPS on small hitboxes. The trait <Trait id="1502"/> in combination with <Item id="24868"/> and Slaying Potions like <Item id="50082"/> put it ahead of other DPS professions. Keep in mind that all six bosses in the current CM fractals are stationary, have a large hitbox and favor burst damage.

Additionally with the new Boon Chronomancer build and an uptime of at least eleven Boons during your burst phases, arcane weaver with <Trait id="1511"/> has become extremly strong.

Weaver has some utilities in the form of some <Condition name="vulnerability"/> output, AoE <Condition name="blind"/>, <Skill id="5536"/> and easy <Boon name="might"/> pre-stacking. The bad news is that Weaver is really squishy compared to the old Tempest, it has no reflects, no crowd control skills apart from <Skill id="5733"/> and looses access to <Boon name="stability"/> and <Boon name="protection"/> from Overloads.

Arcane Weaver somewhat mitigates the squishiness by taking <Trait id="257"/> and creating good <Boon name="protection"/> uptimes per <Trait id="264"/>. It also provides some <Boon name="might"/> uptime on himself and the party. With the trait <Trait id="2004"/> and the Convertion of Agony Resistance to Concentration, an Arcane Weaver will have between 27% and 34.2% Boon Duration. The <Trait id="264"/> Arcane Weaver creates one stack <Boon name="might"/> for 19.05 seconds - 20.13 seconds each time he attunes to <Skill id="5492"/>. With <Boon name="alacrity"/> a Weaver attunes to a new Attunement all 2.55 seconds. Two out of three attunements are <Skill id="5492"/>. This creates under ideal conditions between 4.98 - 5.26 stacks <Boon name="might"/> permanent. Under normal conditions it will be closer to 4 stacks <Boon name="might"/>. Additional he will use <Skill id="5528"/> all 15 seconds creating another 3 and for 75% of the time 6 stacks  <Boon name="might"/> under ideal and under normal condition closer to 3 stacks <Boon name="might"/>. The Weaver gives himself additional 1 stack <Boon name="might"/> whenever he changes attunment through <Trait id="268"/> for 10.16 seconds to 10.736 seconds. Under realistic conditions that are at least 3 additional stacks <Boon name="might"/> on himself. Since the new meta playes with three arcane weaver, this creates around 21 stacks <Boon name="might"/> on the whole group and most of the time 25 stacks <Boon name="might"/> on the Weaver before the <Specialization name="spellbreaker"/> or <Specialization name="chronomancer"/> share any. This might source allows the druid to be replaced, since the group will be <Boon name="might"/> caped without him.

Weaver is currently the strongest DPS for an offensive team setup but relies heavily on fast CC and boon share from other classes. If you play with a Boon Chronomancer and three Weavers take Arcane, if you play with a druid and no Boon Chronomancer take Air.

Rotation
</CardHeader>
<CardContent>
The rotation is very complex and highly depends on a good <Boon name="alacrity"/> uptime. Below is a descending list of priorities:

* Use <Skill id="5501"/> whenever possible and immediately switch to <Skill id="5495"/> while casting. Cast <Skill id="5528"/> before switching back to <Skill id="5492"/>, cast <Skill id="43762"/> and finally another <Skill id="5548"/>
* If <Skill id="5737"/> is of cooldown attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5492"/>. Use <Skill id="5552"/> and <Skill id="41125"/> first so your <Skill id="5737"/> can profit from the better modifier in <Skill id="5492"/>.
    * If <Skill id="5501"/> is ready use <Skill id="5737"/> 	immediately followed by <Skill id="5501"/> and attune back to <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> 
    * If the boss fight will end before another <Skill id="5737"/> will be ready, use <Skill id="5736"/>. This is ideally done while attuning to <Skill id="5495"/>/<Skill id="5492"/>, followed by <Skill id="5528"/>, <Skill id="5501"/>, <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5495"/>, <Skill id="5548"/>, <Skill id="43762"/> and so on.
* While attuned to <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5495"/> or  <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> and <Skill id="5548"/>, <Skill id="41125"/> and <Skill id="43762"/> are on cooldown before you switch to <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> to profit from <Trait id="2131"/>(You will fully attune to <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> while using the first skill.): 
    * In <Skill id="5624"/>:
        * Use <Skill id="5725"/> in the middle of the hitbox for better rng.
        * 2x auto-attack chain
    * Or in <Skill id="5516"/>:
        * Only when you can whirl against a wall <Skill id="5697"/> 
        * <Skill id="5517"/>
        * <Skill id="5531"/> 
    * Or in <Skill id="5567"/>
        * <Skill id="5568"/>
        * <Skill id="5723"/>, 
        * <Skill id="5720"/>
* Use <Skill id="5539"/> three times while double-attuned to <Skill id="5492"/>, <Trait id="2131"/> is up, the breakbar is broken and you have <Skill id="5624"/> in your hand for the ferocity bost. 
* Use <Skill id="5548"/> whenever possible (basically every 6s) and fill the gaps inbetween with the skills listed below
    * Use <Skill id="5679"/> if you can't finish another <Skill id="5491"/> before leaving <Skill id="5492"/>.
    * Switch to <Skill id="5494"/> if off cooldown. <Skill id="41125"/> (and <Skill id="5552"/>) is a DPS increase over auto-attacking while waiting in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> for your <Skill id="5501"/> to be of cooldown.
* Don't start any auto-attacks like <Skill id="5491"/> if you can't finish them. 
* If the boss is at 1-2 % life left and you have no good skills left attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> to get a last burst with <Skill id="41125"/> in.

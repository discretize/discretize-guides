The **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** is an unique build that can be played very effectively in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs, and will almost always outperform <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> (if you find yourself in a slow group, this build can also be an attractive choice for ''slower'' encounters like Ensolyss).

Condi <Specialization name="Weaver"/> can deal very high amounts of damage, and even rival strong builds like <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/> and <BuildLink build="Condi Scourge" specialization="Scourge"/> when played properly.

This build is naturally tanky due to its rotation, having above 90% uptime on the <Skill name="Rocky Loop"/> buff. On top of that damage reduction, it has permanent 10% DR from <Trait name="Geomancer's Training"/> and 7% DR on ~ 40% uptime from <Trait name="Stone Flesh"/>. 

The main downside of **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** apart from the complexity of its rotation is the lack of unique party buffs and overall boon generation, apart from some <Boon name="Might"/> generated by <Skill id="25486"/>.

<Card title="Disclaimer">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

<Card title="Precasting">

### **Precast in non boonstrip fights** 
If you know you can only get one <Skill name="Weave Self"/> during the fight then you can precast it and use the second one later. To do that you have to: 

- Start on <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/>, <Skill name="Arcane Power"/>.
- Attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Weave Self"/>.
- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_ and attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> for <Trait name="Elements of Rage"/>
- Attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and start the fight.

### **Precast in fights with boonstrip** 
In [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs boons and some specific buffs get stripped the moment you enter combat so your precast has to be adjusted. Also these fights favor use of <Skill name="Glyph of Lesser Elementals"/>

- Start on <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/>, <Skill name="Arcane Power"/>.
- Attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Weave Self"/>.
- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_ and attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> for <Trait name="Elements of Rage"/>
- Attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and start the fight

### **Extra Precast for [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs**

If you have an extra set of weapons (or legendary sigils), you can also precast the effects of <Item name="Doom"/> and <Item name="Leeching"/>. To do that:

- Switch to the sigils 
- For Sunqua Peak fall below the stairs before the boss' arena to get in combat and switch to any attunement.
- For Silent Surf let go of the parachute a bit earlier so as you get in combat when you fall down and switch to any attunement. 
- Once you are out of combat, you can switch the sigils back to <Item name="Earth"/> and <Item name="Geomancy"/>.

<Video youtube="-ML_bmcdBPo" caption="by Ryan" />
</Card>

<Card title="Important Notes">

- <Skill name="Signet of Fire"/> is one of your most important DPS skills. Use it off cooldown!

- Make sure to always use <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/> in <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>. If the boss is about to phase or die, your next best option is to use it in <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>. If you find yourself is any other element, you should use it regardless, as it grants increased strike damage on your next few attacks.

- <Skill name="Primordial Stance"/> should be used during <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> for maximum damage output. However, if the boss' breakbar is about to be broken or about to phase, you can also use it during <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> or <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>.

- Although it is important to finish auto attack chains, during <Skill name="Weave Self"/>, you should prioritize using your skills and entering <Skill name="Tailored Victory"/>, even if it means skipping some auto attacks. Maintaining the <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> buff of <Skill name="Weave Self"/> is most important.

- In the video, a 2nd <Skill name="Weave Self"/> rotation is shown, which is different from the 1st. However, due to the faster nature of fractal bosses, you will either phase the boss before you reach the 2nd rotation or there will be enough downtime to reset to the written rotation when <Skill name="Weave Self"/> is on cooldown.

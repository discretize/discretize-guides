<Message>
This build performs best in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and [Siren's Reef](/fractals/siren's-reef). Outside of these 2 fractal, it will fall behind <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> due to its fairly slower damage ramp-up.
</Message>

The **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** is an unique build that can be played very effectively in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and [Siren's Reef](/fractals/siren's-reef), and will almost always outperform <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> (if you find yourself in a slow group, this build can also be an attractive choice for ''slower'' encounters like Ensolyss and Arkk).

Condi <Specialization name="Weaver"/> can deal very high amounts of damage, and even rival [META](/guides/meta-explained) builds like <BuildLink build="Condi Soulbeast" specialization="Soulbeast"/> and <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> when played properly.

This build is naturally tanky due to its rotation, having easy access to skills that provide evasion frames with <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, barrier with <Skill name="Lava Skin"/>, condition cleansing with <Skill name="Magnetic Wave"/> and even <Skill name="Obsidian Flesh"/>, a powerful skill that grants <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> against most attacks. It can also bring some group utility in the form of projectile destruction with <Skill name="Swirling Winds"/>.
 
The main downside of **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** apart from the complexity of its rotation is the lack of unique party buffs and overall boon generation, apart from some <Boon name="Might"/> granted by placing fire fields and randomly blasting them.

<Divider text="Equipment"/>

- Note that the build does not rely on precision as much as the <BuildLink build="Power Weaver" specialization="Weaver"/> variant and you can build your AR around the 150 breakpoint. You should however aim for a fully +9 infused gear setup for maximum <Item id="79722"/> stat conversion value.

|Heal|
| <Skill name="Arcane Brilliance" size="big" disableText/> | An additional <Boon name="Might"/> source from blasting fire fields. Overall provides less healing than <Skill name="Signet Of Restoration"/>
| <Skill name="Glyph of Elemental Harmony" size="big" disableText/> | A stronger alternative healing skill when you need to restore a large amount of health very quickly.
| <Skill name="Aquatic stance" size="big" disableText/> | Another alternative healing skill affecting allies close to the target you strike.|
|Offensive|
| <Skill name="Glyph of Lesser Elementals" size="big" disableText/> | A rather unreliable ulternative to  <Skill name="Glyph of Elemental Power"/> due to the nature of the pet's AI. Use with caution.|
|Defensive|
| <Skill name="Stone Resonance" size="big" disableText/> | A strong skill providing a lot of barrier and extra <Boon name= "Stability"/>.|
| Utility |
| <Skill name="Glyph of Renewal" size="big" disableText/> | You can sacrifice some extra damage for a powerful insta rez, can be very useful during "Dancing with Demons" runs in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak)

<Message>
If you do want to switch any of your utilites in favor of one of the skills listed above, you should prioritise dropping <Skill name="Glyph of Elemental Power"/> before <Skill name="Primordial Stance"/> and <Skill name="Signet of fire"/>.

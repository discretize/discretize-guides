The **<Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/>** plays with a mix of harrier's and cleric's gear for maximum power and healing power while still hitting 100% boon duration.
 
Since the damage and life steals of <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit" /> are based on the **<Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/>**'s own power and healing power, the <Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/> aims to maximize those stats.

Feel free to run full Harrier if you are confident that you don't need the extra healing power or toughness from cleric. The more agony resistance you have, the more cleric you can afford to run and still hit 100% boon duration.

If you run out of energy too quickly, we recommend the Salvation/Invocation variant. This variant is also better for fractals where <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/> doesn't help your party. This would include fractals where damage is time-gated and where you can't critically hit the enemies that matter.

You should consider running this trait variant in fractals like Molten Furnace and Captain Mai Trin.

<Message>
You will need to reconsider the legends you are running in almost every fractal and therefore it is a nice habit to develop to check them after each fractal you have done. Some fractals demand three to four different legends in only one fractal. Below you will find the three most common setups that will serve you fine as well as description of the skills in each legend.
</Message>

## Legends Setups:

1. **<Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>** and **<Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/>**
   - This is you most used setup that has the most healing output as well as a projectile block and extra condition cleanse.
2. **<Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>** and **<Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>**
   - This is a specific setup for the instability <Effect name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and for when you want to increase your damage output on bosses that generate <Boon name="Protection"/> on themselves or when you need to pull adds using <Skill name="Call to Anguish"/>.
3. **<Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>** and **<Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>**
   - This is the setup you want to use on a few CM bosses (Skorvald and Artsariiv) as well as some fractals (Chaos last boss, possibly in Siren's Reef).

**Precast**
* Wait for your teammates to drop a fire field and in case you have a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, wait until they use <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> which increases your boon duration by 20 %.
* Your prestacking is relatively simple and follows the same pattern on every boss. Cast <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> and <Skill name="Renewing Wave"/> and take the mistlock and cast them again.

**100 - 75%**  

* Cast <Skill name="DarkrazorsDaring"/> on MAMA as soon as the red circle appear.
* Cast <Skill name="IcerazorsIre"/> right before MAMA becomes vulnerable.
* Use <Skill name="Surgeofthemists"/> to break the defiance bar. Be aware of your positioning to gain an additional hit.
* Swap your weapons as soon as you are no longer in MAMA's hitbox where your <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> could hit so you stop casting that skill to save some time.
* Swap your legend to <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/> and cast <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> on MAMA and use <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/>.

**1st Knight**

* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Renegade stance"/> to use <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> to share <Boon name="might"/>.

**75-50%**
* Cast <Skill name="SoulcleavesSummit"/> under MAMA so your teammates get some extra damage and get some healing. If they are already at max health, you can save <Skill name="SoulcleavesSummit"/> for a bit later, since there will be a dome attack from MAMA after the first knight. Be sure to have around 25-35 energy at the end of the phase to be able to cast <Skill name="DarkrazorsDaring"/>.
* Share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> when off cooldown.

* Use <Skill name="Surge of the Mists"/> through MAMA, and weapon swap to swords.
* When MAMA is CC'd you should use your <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> and <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/> as they deal the largest amount of damage in your kit and there shouldn't be a need for heals. If your allies need heals, remember to use <Skill name="Natural Harmony"/>
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Renegade stance"/> for the upcoming add.
* Share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> when off cooldown.

* Swap back to <Skill name="LegendaryRenegadestance"/> and be ready to cast <Skill name="IcerazorsIre"/> where your designated echo will spawn.

The <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is one of the professions with the most support and utility. It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>, and if that is not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>.

Damage-wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other damage dealing classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter; in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS players sweaty.

Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Information>
<Specialization name="Renegade"/> requires 33.3% <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> minimum to maintain <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, pressing <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> off-cooldown. Due to the nature of most fractal encounters, <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> close to this can safely be run thanks to precasting and short phases/fights (especially when precasting with a high <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> gearset). If you want more room for error and safer uptimes, use the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your build.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Trait name="Incensed Response" size="big" disableText/>    | Will increase your personal <Boon name="Might"/> generation and is taken as an alternative to <Trait name="Spirit Boon"/> if you are not maintaining 25 stacks.                                                  |
| <Trait name="Lasting Legacy" size="big" disableText/> | This trait will allow you to provide 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> to your party through <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> . 
Note: If you also want to provide 100% <Boon name="Alacrity"/> in longer fights you will need 100% Boon Duration, however on shorter fights or in fast/static groups you may be able to get away with 0% Boon duration if you precast 30s of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> at the _Mistlock Singularity_. <Boon name="Alacrity"/> can then be maintained for around 1 minute 10s. Any fights longer than that should use a different approach. (The same applies to <Trait name="Vindication"/>)
| <Trait name="Vindication" size="big" disableText/>    | This trait is a personal DPS increase by increasing the missile count by up to 15.. It can be used on shorter fights where you can precast most of the required <Boon name="Alacrity"/> at the _Mistlock Singularity_ as mentioned in the above note.   
                                                                                                                                            |

### Dealing with No Pain, No Gain
<Warning>

Note that with a build like <Specialization name="Scrapper"/>, <Specialization name="Virtuoso"/>, <Specialization name="Scourge"/>, or <Specialization name="Specter"/> who can strip boons while doing their rotation, you shouldn't have to deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> on most fights. Although there will be some T4s where you will need to help and also on Arkk and MAMA depending on the build.
</Warning>

There are multiple weapons in your arsenal to deal with the instability <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and make it easier to manage the boons that the enemy will receive from this instability. For fractals with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> it is recommended to run a staff with <Item id="72872"/> instead of a <Item id="24615"/>. The <Item id="72872"/> will transfer three boons from enemies to you when you interrupt an attack. For enemies with a defiance bar, using a CC skill while the enemy is casting any ability counts as interrupting, even if there is no "_interrupted_" message. This can also be run on Greatsword or Sword instead of <Item id="24868"/> if necessary, and the boonstrip can be procced with <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/>

<Weapons weapon1MainType="Staff" weapon1MainAffix="Diviner" weapon1MainSigil1="Severance" weapon1MainSigil2="Absorption" unembossed />

<div style={{marginBottom: "16px"}} />

As for legends that you want to run, the general rule of thumb in groups that perform at least relatively well is to run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>. If you find the stability to be an issue on Artsariiv in slower groups where <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> isn't enough to cover the <Boon name="Stability"/>, you can run <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> or alternatively heavily rely on your <Item id="72872"/> to strip the boons and run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>. However, this isn't recommended due to the unreliability of <Item id="72872"/>.

### Breakdown of Ability Usage

- <Trait name="Rising Tide"/> - Always taken. It provides a 7% damage increase while your health is above 90%.
- <Trait name="Charged Mists"/> - Always taken. One of the key parts to being a Renegade playing is Legend swapping below 10 energy to ativate this trait, granting bonus 25 energy.
- <Trait name="Ashen Demeanor"/> - Always taken. Provides <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> to CC'd targets.
- <Trait name="Brutal Momentum"/> - Increases Critical chance when endurance is full. Try to anticipate mechanics that require dodging and replace it with <Skill name="Warding Rift"/> , <Skill name="Unrelenting Assault"/> or  <Skill name="Imperial Guard"/>.

### Legends

**<Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>**: Recent patches have changed Renegade Stance interaction. Be mindful of interactions with itself and <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/>.
Activating a stance automatically applies <Boon name="Protection"/> from the trait, <Trait name="All for One"/>.

- <Skill name="Breakrazors Bastion"/> - Heal skill that when buffed, provides barrier. In general this skill should be used to apply the 'Band Together' trait for other stances.
- <Skill name="Razorclaws Rage"/> - Can be used to apply <Condition name="Bleeding"/> on attack for a party. Can be used in situations where you have excess energy.
- <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> - Your main CC skill as a Renegade. <Control name="Daze"/>s enemies in an area around it for 600 Defiance bar damage. Is also used as a <Control name="Stun"/> break. However be mindful that this does activate <Trait name="Contained Temper"/>, giving 15 extra energy. Make sure to **NOT** legend swap after stun breaking to activate <Trait name="Charged Mists"/>.
- <Skill name="Icerazors Ire"/> - The highest damage skill for Renegade stance. Applies <Condition name="Vulnerability"> on targets.</Condition>. Try to enhance this with other stances to provide extra damage through chilled. Use this after <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> in an opener to enhance the damage.
- <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/> - This skill now prevents energy drain. Can be used for the purposes of a fire field for precasting or blasting mid fights, however in general, is used the least as a part of the rotation.

---

**<Skill name="Legendary Assassin Stance"/>**: Default stance that provides the highest damage.

- <Skill name="Enchanted Daggers"/> - Provides lifesteal for the next 6 attacks. Does also provide a small DPS increase and can be used when extra energy is available. Often used in precasting.
- <Skill name="Phase Traversal"/> - Shadowsteps you to your target. This is useful in a lot of situations with bypassing terrain and works in a similar way to skills such as a Guardian's <Skill name="Judge's Intervention"/>. Often used for various skips in different fratals.
- <Skill name="Riposting Shadows"/> - Stunbreaks and evades backwards. This also activates <Trait name="Contained Temper"/> if used as such. Be mindful, that following up with skills with a gap closer such as <Skill name="Death strike"/> will be needed to re-engage the boss.
- <Skill name="Impossible Odds"/> - **Toggle:** Provides bonus hits to a target. In general, this should always be activated as part of the Shiro rotation.
- <Skill name="Jade Winds"/> - Primarily used to <Control name="Stun"/> multiple enemies (up to 5). For the energy cost, this is not the most effective, however due to the AoE nature, it can be used on bosses such as Artsariiv during the 33% clone phase by standing between 2 clones.

---

**<Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>**: Used primarily to give <Boon name="Stability"/> to a party.

- <Skill name="Soothing Stone"/> - The only self-heal for revenant that condition cleanses. Primarily used when coupled when <Condition name="Immobolize"/> effects are applied to you such as buttons for Aetherblade and chains for Cliffside.
- <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/> - Grants <Boon name="Stability"/> to your party. In pugs, most healers are now able to provide stability. However, it is always good to check in case they are unable to do so.
- <Skill name="Forced Engagement"/> - A chain is attached to a target, applying <Condition name="Taunt"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>. One of the strongest slow CCs skills for Revenant.
- <Skill name="Vengeful Hammers"/> - **Toggle:** A weaker version of <Skill name="Impossible Odds"/>, however does provide self-sustain through healing per hammer hit. Can be used just like impossible odds, but remember that the purpose of this stance is to provide <Boon name="Stability"/>. Ensure that you have arund 30 energy for <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/> when needed.
- <Skill name="Rite of the Great Dwarf"/> - High energy costs stunbreak which reduces incoming damage for your party. Try to avoid using this skill as much as possible.

---

**<Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>**: Used mostly to boon strip on fractals with <Instability name="No Pain No Gain"/>. If you are unfamiliar with players/classes/specialisation, check to make sure they do not have in built boon strip as part of their rotation.

- <Skill name="Empowering Misery"/> - A decent self-heal that heals more for each unique condition on you.
- <Skill name="Pain Absorption"/> - Mostly used as a stunbreak or to provide <Boon name="Resistance"/> to yourself and your party. Often used to bypass the effect of <Condition name="Immobolize"/>.
- <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> - Costs 20 energy to remove three boons from enemies for fractals with <Instability name="No Pain No Gain"/>. Remember that this instability happens every 20 seconds, so try to plan your rotation around that 20 second gap. 
- <Skill name="Call to Anguish"/> - Leap skill that pulls five nearby enemies together. Often used as a skip or a CC.
- <Skill name="Embrace the Darkness"/> - **Toggle:** Decent energy drain effect that provides <Condition name="Torment"/> to nearby enemies. Again, can be used in a similar way to <Skill name="Impossible Odds"/> but bear in mind why you are using this stance to begin with.

---

**<Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/>**: The strongest supportive stance in your arsenal. Is not used for damage, but mostly for its utility, namely <Skill name="Protective Solace"/>. This stance can be empowered by Renegade skills.

- <Skill name="Project Tranquility"/> - Summons Ventari's Tablet. Must be used in order to activate other skills. If <Skill name="Energy Expulsion"/> was used, remember to activate this ability to regain access to your other skills.
- <Skill name="Ventaris Will"/> - Move Ventari's Tablet to the target location.
- <Skill name="Protective Solace"/> - **Toggle:** The most impotant skill for a lot of damage/mechanic mitigation in non-CM fractals. Summons a protective barrier that **absorbs** (not reflect) projectiles around the tablet. Especially useful in Uncategorised to block harpy arrows and lasers when running up the ramp.
- <Skill name="Natural Harmony"/> - Can be used to heal the party if needed. Used more on Heal-based revenant builds, but can be used in a pinch.
- <Skill name="Purifying Essence"/> - Heals allies per condition cleansed (up to 3 conditions).
- <Skill name="Energy Expulsion"/> - Drains 35 energy to explode Ventari's Tablet, cleansing one condition. If this skill is enhanced by a Renegade stance, it also provides 3x <Boon name="Stability"/> to a party.

    title: Overview
    content: >
      <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is the profession with the most support
      and utility among all META classes. It provides permanent <Boon
      name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill
      name="Heroic Command"/>, a unique buff over 150 <Attribute
      name="Ferocity"/> with <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/> and if that is
      not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also
      excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and
      <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>.


      Damage-wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other META classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter; in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS players sweaty.


      Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

      | <Trait id="1754" size="big" disableText/> | On a lot of encounters and especially in slower groups, <Trait name="SwiftTermination"/> will be worse than <Trait name="DanceOfDeath"/>. <Trait name="SwiftTermination"/> offers less survivability but is burstier. |

      | <Trait id="1781" size="big" disableText/> | If you can't profit from <Trait id="1774"/> and your <Boon name="Might"/> uptimes are low.                                                                                                                            |

      <Card title="Herald Precasting">


      Sometimes it is worth precasting with <Specialization name="Herald"/> because <Specialization name="Herald"/> has access to <Skill id="51667"/> which is _incredibly_ strong skill to precast, if you can manage to fit it into your groups precasting. If your group is blasting <Boon name="Might"/>, you can forgo using <Skill id="29321"/> in your precasting and just precast <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and extending everyone else's boons with <Skill id="51667"/>.


      It is recommended to have a build template for this, so you can quickly swap between templates by using hotkeys (need to be set up in the settings). Here's the Herald trait line:<Traits traits1Id="52" traits1="Herald" traits1SelectedIds="1806,1738,1772" unembossed/>


      Template code: `[&DQkDKgwrNCbcEQAABhIAACsSAADUEQAAyhEAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]`


      <Warning>

      The other legend is unselected for a good reason. If you have the other legend slot empty, it will minimise the number of possible bugs with <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and build templates. You can read more about the bugs [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Template#Build_Template).

      </Warning>


      To precast with <Specialization name="Herald"/>, you can go very simple:


      1.  Start on <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and use <Skill id="45537"/>.


      2.  Swap to <Specialization name="Herald"/> template and use <Skill id="51667"/>.


      3.  Take the Mistlock Singularity.


      4.  Cast <Skill id="51667"/> again.


      5.  Swap to <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and use <Skill id="45537"/>.

      <Card title="Abilities">


      **Citadel Order Skills:**


      - <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> - Share two stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> for each <Uncategorized name="kallasfervor"/> stack.


      - <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> - Fire ten missiles that inflict high damage and <Condition name="Burning"/>.

      ---


      **Sword Skills:**


      - <Skill name="Preparation Thrust"/> - The auto-attack chain cleaves and provides <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on the two first attacks. The third attack creates an exploding rift on up to three targets, with each explosion hitting three targets. Potentially hitting nine times.


      - <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/> - High damage skill with low cooldown and energy cost, also provides <Condition name="Chilled"/>. The second attack deals increased damage to isolated enemies.


      - <Skill name="Unrelenting Assault"/> - A two second evade that also provides <Boon name="Might"/> to yourself.


      - <Skill name="Shackling Wave"/> - High damage skill, however, should be used in key moments due to the energy cost, cooldown, and application of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.


      - <Skill name="Death strike"/> - Shadowstep to the target, grants two hits with decent damage. Should be used in key moments, unless energy and timing allow it to be used for damage.


      **Staff Skills:**


      - <Skill name="Rapid Swipe"/> - The auto-attack chain cleaves and the last hit provides a small amount of healing to allies.


      - <Skill name="Menders Rebuke"/> - Provides <Condition name="Weakness"/> and a small amount of healing to allies.


      - <Skill name="Warding Rift"/> - A two second block that causes <Condition name="Blinded"/> foes.

      ---


      **Notable Traits:**


      - <Trait name="Swift Termination"/> - 20% damage increase when foe is below 50% health.


      - <Trait name="Dance of Death"/> - When you apply <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> you gain stacks of <Uncategorized name="BattleScars"/>, which makes your attack steal health. This trait is the DPS alternative for <Trait name="Swift Termination"/>. Usually it stands for ~ 10 - 12 % of damage, but doesn't scale with <Effect name="Exposed"/>. Pulls ahead over <Trait name="Swift Termination"/> in fights where majority of damage is dealt outside of <Effect name="Exposed"/> debuff (on Artsariiv and Arkk). Also worth taking in PuG groups on most bosses to ensure Scholar buff uptime and due to lower <Effect name="Exposed"/> uptime on bosses.


      - <Trait name="Rising Tide"/> - 7% damage increase while your health is above 90%.


      - <Trait name="Charged Mists"/> - Grant 25 more energy when you swap Legends below 10 energy.


      - <Trait name="Ashen Demeanor"/> - Disabling a foe provides <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.


      - <Trait name="Brutal Momentum"/> - 33% Critical chance increase when your endurance is full.


      - <Trait name="Lasting Legacy"/> - <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> shares more stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and the duration is increased by 50%.


      - <Trait name="Righteous Rebel"/> - The duration of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> shared from <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> is increased by 50%.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here.

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">
<Card title="Dealing with No Pain, No Gain">
There are multiple weapons in your arsenal to deal with the instability <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and make it easier to manage the boons that the enemy will receive from this instability. For fractals with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> it is recommended to run a staff with <Item id="72872"/> instead of a <Item id="24615"/>. The <Item id="72872"/> will transfer three boons from enemies to you when you interrupt an attack. For enemies with a defiance bar, using a CC skill while the enemy is casting any ability counts as interrupting, even if there is no "*interrupted*" message.

<Weapons weapon1MainType="Staff" weapon1MainAffix="Diviner" weapon1MainSigil1="Severance" weapon1MainSigil2="Absorption" unembossed/>

As for legends that you want to run, the general rule of thumb in groups that perform at least relatively well is to run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>. If you find the stability to be an issue on Artsariiv in slower groups where <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> isn't enough to cover the stability, you can run <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> or alternatively heavily rely on your <Item id="72872"/> to strip the boons and run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>. However, this isn't recommended due to the unreliability of <Item id="72872"/>.

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">
<Card title="Notes">

Ideally you would want to do your burst rotation under the effect of <Effect name="Exposed"/> and while your <Skill name="Impossibleodds"/> is up. This might not always be possible if you need to reserve energy for boons or in the case that your legend timings are off.

With <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> you would want to use these abilities with <Skill name="Embrace the darkness"/> on.

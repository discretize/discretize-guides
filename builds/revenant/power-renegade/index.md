<Specialization name="Renegade"/> is the profession with the most support and utility among all META classes. It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>, a unique buff over 150 <Attribute name="Ferocity"/> with <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/>, an insanely strong party heal and additional damage with <Skill name="soulcleavessummit"/>, and if that is not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>. 

Damage-wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other META classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter; in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS player sweaty. 

Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from  <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

- Check the [gear optimizer](http://old.discretize.eu) for more gear variants!
- Check the CM-guides for information when to play 50% and 80% boon duration. For newer <Specialization name="Renegade"/>s it is recommended to play at least 80% boon duration.

<Card title="Herald Precasting">
Sometimes it is worth precasting with <Specialization name="Herald"/> because <Specialization name="Herald"/> has access to <Skill id="51667"/> which is *incredibly* strong skill to precast, if you can manage to fit it into your groups precasting. If your group is blasting <Boon name="Might"/>, you can forgo using <Skill id="29321"/> in your precasting and just precast <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and extending everyone else's boons with <Skill id="51667"/>.

It is recommended to have a build template for this, so you can quickly swap between templates by using hotkeys (need to be setup in the settings). Here's the Herald trait line:
<Traits unembossed traits1Id="52" traits1="Herald" traits1SelectedIds="1806,1738,1772"/>

<Message>
The other legend is unselected for a good reason. If you have the other legend slot empty, it will minimise the amount of possible bugs with <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and build templates. You can read more about the bugs [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Template#Build_Template).
</Message>

To precast with <Specialization name="Herald"/>, you can go very simple:

1. Start on <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and use <Skill id="45537"/>.
2. Swap to <Specialization name="Herald"/> template and use <Skill id="51667"/>.
3. Take the Mistlock Singularity.
4. Cast <Skill id="51667"/> again.
5. Swap to <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and use <Skill id="45537"/>.

---

**Sword Skills:**

- <Skill name="Preparation Thrust"/> - The auto-attack chain cleaves and provides <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on the two first attacks. The third attack creates an exploding rift on up to three targets, with each explosion hitting three targets. Potentially hitting nine times. 
- <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/> - High damage skill with low cooldown and energy cost, also provides <Condition name="Chilled"/>. The second attack deals increased damage to isolated enemies.
- <Skill name="Unrelenting Assault"/> - A two second evade that also provides <Boon name="Might"/> to yourself. 
- <Skill name="Shackling Wave"/> - High damage skill, however should be used in key moments due to the energy cost, cooldown, and application of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.
- <Skill name="Death strike"/> - Shadowsteps to target, grants two hits with decent damage. Should be used in key moments, unless energy and timing allow it to be used for damage. 

**Staff Skills:**

- <Skill name="Rapid Swipe"/> - The auto-attack chain cleaves and the last hit provides a small amount of healing to allies.
- <Skill name="Menders Rebuke"/> - Provides <Condition name="Weakness"/> and a small amount of healing to allies.

Pulls ahead over <Trait name="Swift Termination"/> in fights where majority of damage is dealt outside of <Effect name="Exposed"/> debuff (on Artsariiv and Arkk). Also worth taking in PuG groups on most bosses to ensure Scholar buff uptime and due to lower <Effect name="Exposed"/> uptime on bosses.
- <Trait name="Rising Tide"/> - 7% damage increase while your health is above 90%. 
- <Trait name="Charged Mists"/> - Grant 25 more energy when you swap Legends below 10 energy.

<Grid>
<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">

<Card title="Information">
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  

For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here.

<Card title="Dealing with No Pain, No Gain">

There are multiple weapons in your arsenal to deal with the instability <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and make it easier to manage the boons that the enemy will receive from this instability. For fractals with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> it is recommended to run a staff with <Item id="72872"/> instead of a <Item id="24615"/>. The <Item id="72872"/> will transfer three boons from enemies to you when you interrupt an attack. For enemies with a defiance bar, using a CC skill while the enemy is casting any ability counts as interrupting, even if there is no "*interrupted*" message.

<Weapons unembossed weapon1MainType="Staff" weapon1MainAffix="Diviner" weapon1MainSigil1="Severance" weapon1MainSigil2="Absorption"/>

As for legends that you want to run, the general rule of thumb in groups that perform at least relatively well is to run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>. If you find the stability to be an issue on Artsariiv in slower groups where <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> isn't enough to cover the stability, you can run <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> or alternatively heavily rely on your <Item id="72872"/> to strip the boons and run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>. However, this isn't recommended due to the unreliability of <Item id="72872"/>.

Ideally you would want to do your burst rotation under the effect of <Effect name="Exposed"/> and while your <Skill name="Impossibleodds"/> is up. This might not always be possible if you need to reserve energy for boons or in the case that your legend timings are off.

With <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/> you would want to use these abilities with <Skill name="Embrace the darkness"/> on.

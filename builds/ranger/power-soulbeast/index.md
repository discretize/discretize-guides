The <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills. Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv). The build benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

This build is rather self-sufficient due to:

- <Boon name="Quickness"/> from <Trait name="livefast"/>
- <Boon name="Might"/> from <Trait name="Huntersgaze"/>
- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/>
- High CC with <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> and <Skill name="pathofscars"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="monarchsleap"/>, <Skill id="45743"/> and <Skill id="12521"/>

Overall this is a very well-rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

This build can be played assuming you have a high flanking uptime on bosses. In most cases with good positioning this is achievable. If not, or you don't want to worry about your positioning run the Marksmanship build.

This build should be played if you cannot reliably flank the boss you are attacking. Or if you need to benefit from <Trait name="Farsighted"/> (e.g. to range a Skorvald island).

If you do not want to get as much Assassins gear, you can play with <Item id="24723"/> and adjust your gear using the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/).

<Card title="Skirmishing and Fractals">

Running Skirmishing in fractals is quite a niche choice, you need to satisfy **the following requirements:**

- You can be sure that you can flank the boss permanently.
- You want to replace a <Specialization name="Berserker"/> by providing your team with <Trait name="Spotter"/> so they can crit cap.
- You are running a double Soulbeast comp and need <Trait name="Quickdraw"/> to reduce your <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> cooldown.

If you meet these requirements then you can swap Marksmanship for Skirmishing with the following trait setup:<Traits traits1="Skirmishing" traits1Id="30" traits1SelectedIds="1069,1016,1888" unembossed/>

<Warning>
<p>
<Trait name="trappersexpertise"/> is worth over <Trait id="1069"/> if it allows you to get another <Skill name="Frost trap"/> in a phase.

The main idea of <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> (as with all classes) is to ensure you get as much damage into the <Effect name="Exposed"/> buff. As your largest damage skill you want to ensure that <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> under the effects of <Skill name="Sicem"/> is your first priority when you see <Effect name="Exposed"/> on the boss.

Also as <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> you have quite a few ticking damage over time AoEs, such as <Skill name="Barrage"/> and <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> (as well as <Skill id="5531"/> if you have <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>). You want to precast these AoEs where possible when you know that the boss is about to be <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

In PuGs, however, it is quite hard to predict when the boss will be CC'd as well as phases can last a lot longer than expected, because of this the golem rotation is listed in the next section so that you can resort back to it if you end up in a longer phase.

**Weapon Variations:**

For your First weapon set you have a choice of 3 weapons:

- Longbow is a default pick for fractal <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> as it has a higher burst potential through the ability to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> which is high damage ticking AoE, however, you will end up with lower damage if your phases are too long since its auto attacks are very weak. Longbow synergizes well with <Item id="84505"/> which you can proc for a nice damage bonus.
- Warhorn is a strong weapon to run if you cannot cast another <Skill name="Barrage"/> during the fight. "
- Greatsword offers great sustained DPS. You need to be smart about utilizing the <Uncategorized name="attackofopportunity"/> effect that you gain from <Skill id="12525"/>. Finally, you also have <Skill name="Counterattack"/> which is a handy block in certain scenarios. It also allows you to move quickly around in fractals thanks to <Skill id="12521"/>. The greatsword is generally worth taking if your phases end during the downtime of the Longbow rotation (e.g. stuck auto-attacking) and you don't have time for another Longbow burst.


For your second weapon set, you always want Axe off-hand, but for main-hand, you have a choice of 3 weapons again:

- **You should mostly run a main-hand Axe as it offers the highest damage of all main hand weapons.** 
- You may take a main-hand sword for its movement skills: <Skill name="Monarchs leap"/> and <Skill name="Hornet sting"/>.
- Dagger, although its lower DPS than Sword in fractals can be taken and also has <Skill name="Instinctive Engage"/> which is a nice source of <Boon name="Quickness"/>.

**Pets:**

- For pets you simply run <Skill id="43636" disableText/> [Rock Gazelle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Rock_Gazelle) if you need CC or <Skill id="44617" disableText/> [Red Moa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Red_Moa) if you don't. **It is safer to just run Gazelle most of the time and only swap to Moa when you are sure you don't need the CC. You never know when a little CC can come in handy!**
- You want to have <Skill id="31568" disableText/> [Smokescale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Smokescale) on swap to have quick access if you need stealth for skips at any point.

**Utility Skills:**

- **You should never swap out <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> or <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> as they are both massive damage buffs both personally and for the team!**
- You want to always run <Skill name="Sicem"/> as it grants you a **25% damage bonus** for its duration. One thing to keep in mind is that it only grants you a 25% damage bonus against the foe you use it on, so if you are cleaving trash mobs it might not be worth using. Secondly, you only get the buff if you are in <Skill id="42944"/> so also don't activate it if you are unmerged.
- Your final utility varies depending on the situation. Generally, you want to run either <Skill name="Signet of the Wild"/> since that is your most damaging utility

  - <Skill name="Signet of the Wild"/> is taken on fights where no other utility is needed.
  - <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> is another common final utility used to extend boons in your party allowing very offensive comps to be run.

- Most healing skills on ranger are quite useful: <Skill name="We heal as one"/> is a large heal and extends the boons on yourself thanks to <Skill id="42944"/>. Secondly <Skill name="Bear stance"/> is a great condi cleanse either personally or for your team. Finally <Skill name="Troll unguent"/> is a ticking heal that can be useful for pushing orbs at Arkk to enter the damage field.

**Extra Notes:**

- <Trait name="Essence of speed"/> in combination with <Trait name="Live fast"/> means that using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> extends your boons, this can be helpful in Ensolyss split phases to maintain boons on yourself. The healing skill <Skill name="We heal as one"/> also allows you to extend boons on yourself.
- <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr"/> in combination with the <Item id="85244"/> allows you to move extremely fast and is useful for a few skips. Check the [Fractal Guides](/fractals) for specific skips.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations from raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason you can find a video below with openers for each of the CM bosses:

Your other train lines remain the same as on land. The reason for swapping traits here is to provide a 10% damage increase and cooldown reduction on spear skills.
</Card>

<Card title="Underwater Rotation">

For a DPS rotation the same rules apply as above land, try to fit lots of damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/> and <Skill name="One wolf pack"/>. You want to start on Harpoon gun and use <Skill id="12528"/> (Harpoon Gun 3) and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> (Harpoon Gun 4) to precast damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/>. Outside of that precasting, you want to camp Spear since <Skill name="Man o war"/> (Spear 5), <Skill name="Swirling Strike"/> (Spear 2), as well as your auto-attack chain deals good damage. You should swap back to Harpoon gun at the start of the split-phase of the Jellyfish Beast to range the split adds as well as allow you to restart your rotation when the split-phase ends.

**Bonus Tips:**

- If you know that a blockable attack is coming then be sure to use <Skill name="Counterstrike"/> (Skill 4) since you can proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> for a nice 10% damage bonus.
- At the end of a phase you can use <Skill id="12528"/> (Harpoon 3) and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> (Harpoon 4) again.

<Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that in addition provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills.

Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv).

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card title="Trait variations">
- First slot of Marksmanship - <Trait name="Clarion Bond"/> can be useful if the blast and team might is more advantageous than the self might from <Trait name="Huntersgaze"/>
- Second slot of Beastmastery - If you are running longbow then you gain less benefit from <Trait name="Two-handed training"/> so both other traits in that slot can be options. <Trait name="Wilting Strike"/> can be useful if your weaver wants weakness uptime for <Trait name="Superior Elements"/>. <Trait name="Natural healing"/> is some passive healing if you would like it.
- Third slot of Soulbeast - <Trait id="2143"/> can be an alternative if you can precast <Skill name="One wolf pack"/> with <Trait name="Leader of the pack"/> then swap traits right before you get in combat so your allies get the buff but you also end up with the higher personal DPS of having a 10% damage modifier.
- **If you can be 100% sure that you have the ability to flank the boss permanently** then you can consider swapping Marksmanship for Skirmishing with the following setup:

<GridItem sm="7">
<Card title="Skill Usage">
The main idea of <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> (as with all classes) is to ensure you get as much damage into the <Effect name="exposed"/> buff. As your largest damage skill you want to ensure that <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> under the effects of <Skill name="Sicem"/> is your first priority when you see <Effect name="exposed"/> on the boss. Also as Soulbeast you have quite a few ticking damage over time aoes, such as <Skill name="Barrage"/> and <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> (as well as <Skill id="5531"/> if you have <Skill id="5516"/> from your weaver). You want to precast these aoes where possible when you know that the boss is about to be <Effect name="exposed"/>.  

**Weapon usage:**
- As a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> you want to always run offhand axe as it grants you access to <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>, your highest damage skill, as well as <Skill id="12638"/>, a useful pull skill for adds.
- As a mainhand you want to usually run Sword unless you have a short phase where you don't need to autoattack much in which case you should run mainhand axe so you can use <Skill name="Winters bite"/> just before the phase ends.
- For your second weaponset you either run greatsword or longbow:
  - Longbow offers higher burst through the ability to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> but falls off if you end up back on longbow and have to autoattack for a sustained period. Longbow also allows you to proc <Item id="84505"/> with <Skill id="12511"/> for a nice damage bonus.
  - Greatsword is the choice for if you have a long sustained dps phase that allows you to loop your rotation nicely. It offers nice movement through <Skill id="12521"/> as well as a nice damage bonus on your next skill when using <Skill id="12525"/>.

**Pet usage:**
- For pets you simply run <Skill id="43636" disableText/> [Rock Gazelle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Rock_Gazelle) if you need CC or <Skill id="44617" disableText/> [Red Moa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Red_Moa) if you don't. **It is safer to just run Gazelle most of the time and only swap to Moa when you are absolutely sure you don't need the CC. You never know when a little CC can come in handy!**
- You want to have <Skill id="31568" disableText/> [Smokescale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Smokescale) on swap to have quick access if you need stealth for skips at any point.

**Utility skill usage:**
- You want to always run <Skill name="Sicem"/> as it grants you a **40% damage bonus**. One thing to keep in mind is that it only grants you 40% damage bonus against the targetted foe, so if you are cleaving trash mobs it might not be worth using as you would only get a damage bonus against one foe if you used it.
- The choice between <Skill name="Frost trap"/> and <Skill name="Signet of the wild"/> depends on a lot of factors, mainly the phase length and downtime on phases where trap can recharge. For example on Skorvald you can use <Skill name="Frost trap"/> at the start of each phase into <Effect name="exposed"/> since it recharges during the island phase so trap is an obvious pick over signet.
- For healing skills the usual choice is between <Skill name="We heal as one"/>, which extends your boons on use and is quite a large heal, and <Skill name="Bear stance"/>, which is nice if you need to cleanse condis either personally or for your team. Finally <Skill name="Troll unguent"/> is a ticking heal that can be useful for example pushing orbs at arkk.
- **You should never swap out <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> or <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> as they are both massive damage buffs both personally and for the team.**

- <Trait name="Essence of speed"/> in combination with <Trait name="Live fast"/> means that using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> extends your boons, this can be helpful in Ensolyss split phase to maintain boons on yourself. The healing skill <Skill name="We heal as one"/> also allows you to extend boons on yourself.

<Card title="Precast Rotation">
If you have a Mistlock Singularity present you can use this rotation
1. If a fire field isn’t present, equip an offhand torch and use <Skill id="12504"/>.
2. <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> __with <Trait name="Leader of the Pack"/>__.
3. `Optional` use <Skill id="12537"/> then change back the utility that it was in place of.
3. <Skill id="12621"/> to blast might.
4. <Skill id="31914"/> to extend your boons.
5. Pick up <Skill id="5516"/> if there is one.
6. <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> then take the Mislock and trigger the boss

If you don't have Mistlock Singularity present you can use this simplified rotation
1. If a fire field isn’t present, equip an offhand torch and use <Skill id="12504"/>.

3. <Skill id="12621"/> to blast might.
4. <Skill id="31914"/> to extend your boons.
5. Pick up <Skill id="5516"/> if there is one.

<Card title="Underwater">
Underwater you can merge with <Skill id="44514" disableText/> [Tiger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Tiger) for DPS or <Skill id="42797" disableText/> [Shark](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Shark) for mobility. Use <Skill id="40625"/> and <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> for DPS on Tiger and <Skill id="42797"/> for mobility on Shark. **Be careful when you swap pets since you can no longer pet swap in combat.**

<Skill name="Bear stance"/> in combination with <Trait name="leader of the pack"/> can be quite helpful to cleanse conditions on allies since [Aquatic Ruins](/aquatic-ruins) often has <Instability name="Afflicted"/>. 

For DPS rotation the same rules apply as above land, try to fit lots of damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/> and <Skill name="One wolf pack"/>. You want to start on Harpoon gun and use <Skill id="12528"/> and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> to precast damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/>. Outside of that precasting you want to camp Spear since <Skill name="Man o war"/> and <Skill name="Swirling Strike"/> deal good damage. **If you know that a blockable attack is coming then be sure to use <Skill name="Counterstrike"/> since you can proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> for a nice 10% damage bonus.**

**Precast**

Precast <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> on the boss like a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> in disguise. Remember to share <Skill name="Moastance"/> and blast with <Skill name="Callofthewild"/>.

**Opening**
- Summon <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> when you go through the portal.
- Precast <Skill id="5531"/> and then <Skill name="Barrage"/>

- <Skill name="Rapidfire"/> and <Skill id="41524"/> before the breakbar.
- CC: <Skill name="Pointblankshot"/> and <Skill id="45743"/>

- Use <Skill name="onewolfpack"/> in the middle to share it to your allies.
- Autoattack and use <Skill name="Path of scars"/>, <Skill id="45743"/> and <Skill id="41524"/>
- Swap to longbow at around 40% so weapon swap is off cd for phase 3.

**2nd Add**  
- You want to stand at range to benefit from <Trait name="Farsighted"/> as well as you might want to use <Skill name="wehealasone"/> to make sure you have <Trait id="974"/> and <Item id="24836"/> as damage modifiers to kill the add.
- Use longbow skills to kill your add: <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> and <Skill name="rapidfire"/>

The <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that can provide strong party buffs with <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> and other stances, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills. Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv). The build benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.
  
This build is rather self-sufficient due to:

- <Boon name="Quickness"/> from <Trait name="livefast"/>
- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/>
- High CC with <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> and <Skill name="pathofscars"/>

Overall this is a very well-rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

### Swap Weapons
#### Weapon Selections
**Set 1**
- Hammer - is the standard weapon choice for most bosses except a few cases in fast daily kills or speedruns. Remember you can still precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> with Longbow before fights start for extra burst.

  Standard Hammer Skills
  <Skill id="63118" size="big" disableText/><Skill id="63335" size="big" disableText/><Skill id="63075" size="big" disableText/><Skill id="63131" size="big" disableText/><Skill id="63208" size="big" disableText/>
  - If you need some extra CC, swap to <Skill id="63330"/> (Hammer 5). This is particularly usefuil on Artsarriv and MAMA.
  - If you do not need the CC or <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> proc, swap to <Skill id="63197"/>.

- Longbow - is taken on encounters where phases are so short, you do not need to swap back to bow during active phases. Once the phase has finished you should have time to swap back to bow and be ready to burst again. If you find yourself stuck on Longbow at points in a fight where you need extra damage, Hammer will probably be a better option.
- Axe/Warhorn - is a niche weapon choice, but viable on some encounters over Longbow if you don't have access to a Hammer.

**Set 2**
- Mainhand Axe - is taken if a phase ends before you start auto attacking with <Skill name="Ricochet"/> for too long. Also in Low gravity it is preferable to play over Sword.
- Mainhand Sword - is taken when phases are long enough to be autoattacking and the sustained damage is mopre important than the slightly higher Axe burst.

Note: What weapon variations you use heavily depends upon the encounter, fight duration and group you are playing with. Optimally there is no single weaponchoice that fits all scenarios, so take into acount the possible variables, or play the weapons that you enjoy using. 
#### Additional Options 

- Warhorn for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking, can use <Item name="Concentration" type="Sigil"/> in prestack warhorn.
- Weapons with specific slaying sigils and/or <Item name="Night" type="Sigil" /> (see [Cheat Sheet](/guides/cheat-sheet) and [CM Guides](/cm-guides/ranger/power-soulbeast)).
- Longbows or Hammers with <Item name="Severance" type="Sigil"/> are strong for several bosses, especially in faster groups. Check the [Power Soulbeast CM Guide](/cm-guides/ranger/power-soulbeast)) for more information.
- An Axe with <Item name="Severance" type="Sigil"/> instead of <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> in **very fast** groups is good on Artsariiv. Check the [Power Soulbeast CM Guide](/cm-guides/ranger/power-soulbeast)) for more information.

| <Skill name="Signet of the wild" size="big" disableText/> | Your standard 3rd utility, dealing the most damage.|
| <Skill name="Moa Stance" size="big" disableText/>         | Allows all boons that are applied during its uptime to last longer, great for prestacking. Can also be run in fight to allow for other players to run offensive builds.|
| <Skill name="Bear stance" size="big" disableText/>        | Area condi cleanse, also for allies if you play <Trait name="leaderofthepack"/>. Very handy in [Captain Mai Trin](/fractals/captain-mai-trin-boss), [Artsariiv](/fractals/shattered-observatory), and during any fractal with <Instability name="Afflicted"/>.|
| <Skill name="Healing Spring" size="big" disableText/>     | Area condi cleanse, taken if you are playing <Trait name="Oppressivesuperiority"/> or your party needs a long lasting condi cleanse. The same situations described in <Skill name="Bear stance" size="small" disableText /> apply here.|
| <Skill name="Dolyak Stance" size="big" disableText/>      | A team source of <Boon name="Stability"/>, can be taken in T4s such as [Chaos](/fractals/chaos-isles).|
| <Skill name="sharpeningstone" size="big" disableText/>    | Can be used before _Mistlock Singularity_ precast for and swapped with a usual utility for some extra opener DPS.|
| <Skill name="Signet of the hunt" size="big" disableText/>  | A source of <Effect name="Superspeed"/> that allows you to perform skips in combination with <Item id="85244"/>.|
| <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr" size="big" disableText/>  | A source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Effect name="Superspeed"/> that allows you to perform skips in combination with <Item id="85244"/>.|
| <Skill name="Signet of stone" size="big" disableText/>    | Prevents you from taking damage. Can be used to perform skip for the left path in [Deepstone](/fractals/deepstone).

<Divider text="Details"/>

All DPS builds should focus on getting as much damage into the <Effect name="Exposed"/> buff. As your largest damage skill you want to ensure that <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> under the effects of <Skill name="Sicem"/> is your first priority when you see <Effect name="Exposed"/> on the boss.

As <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> you have quite a few ticking damage over time AoEs, such as <Skill name="Barrage"/> and <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> (as well as <Skill id="5531"/> if you have <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>). You want to precast these AoEs where possible when you know that the boss is about to be <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

In PuGs, however, it is quite hard to predict when the boss will be CC'd as well as phases can last a lot longer than expected, because of this the golem rotation is listed in the next section so that you can resort back to it if you end up in a longer phase.

**Weapon Variations:**

For your First weapon set you have a choice of 3 weapons:

- Hammer - is the standard weapon choice for most bosses except a few cases in fast daily kills or speedruns. Remember you can still precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> with Longbow before fights start for extra burst. 
- Longbow - is taken on encounters where phases are so short, you do not need to swap back to bow during active phases. Once the phase has finished you should have time to swap back to bow and be ready to burst again. If you find yourself stuck on Longbow at points in a fight where you need extra damage, Hammer will probably be a better option.
- Axe/Warhorn - is a niche weapon choice, but viable on some encounters over Longbow if you don't have access to a Hammer.

**Set 2**
- Mainhand Axe - is taken if a phase ends before you start auto attacking with <Skill name="Ricochet"/> for too long. Also in Low gravity it is preferable to play over Sword.
- Mainhand Sword - is taken when phases are long enough to be autoattacking and the sustained damage is mopre important than the slightly higher Axe burst.

Note: What weapon variations you use heavily depends upon the encounter, fight duration and group you are playing with. Optimally there is no single weaponchoice that fits all scenarios, so take into acount the possible variables, or play the weapons that you enjoy using. 

**Pets:**

- For pets you simply run <Skill id="43636" disableText/> [Rock Gazelle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Rock_Gazelle) if you need CC or <Skill id="44617" disableText/> [Red Moa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Red_Moa) if you don't. **It is safer to just run Gazelle most of the time and only swap to Moa when you are sure you don't need the CC. You never know when a little CC can come in handy!**
- You want to have <Skill id="31568" disableText/> [Smokescale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Smokescale) on swap to have quick access if you need stealth for skips at any point.

**Utility Skills:**

- **You should never swap out <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> or <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> as they are both massive damage buffs both personally and for the team!**
- You want to **always run <Skill name="Sicem"/>** as it grants you a **25% damage bonus** for its duration. One thing to keep in mind is that it only grants you a 25% damage bonus against the foe you use it on, so if you are cleaving trash mobs it might not be worth using. Secondly, you only get the buff if you are in <Skill id="42944"/> so also don't activate it if you are unmerged.
- Your final utility varies depending on the situation. Generally, you want to run either <Skill name="Signet of the Wild"/> since that is your most damaging utility

  - <Skill name="Signet of the Wild"/> is taken on fights where no other utility is needed.
  - <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> is another common final utility used to extend boons in your party allowing very offensive comps to be run.
  - <Skill name="Dolyak Stance"/> is also useful in certain T4s to provide team stability. Notably, the last boss of [Chaos](/fractals/chaos-isles) and the champion before the boss of [Mai Trin](/fractals/captain-mai-trin-boss).

- Most healing skills on ranger are quite useful: <Skill name="We heal as one"/> is a large heal and extends the boons on yourself thanks to <Skill id="42944"/>. Secondly <Skill name="Bear stance"/> is a great condi cleanse either personally or for your team. It should always be brought for [Mai Trin](/fractals/captain-mai-trin-boss) and can be taken on Artsariiv or other fights with the  [Afflicted](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Instability:_Afflicted) instability.

**Extra Notes:**

- <Trait name="Essence of speed"/> in combination with <Trait name="Live fast"/> means that using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> extends your boons, this can be helpful in Ensolyss split phases to maintain boons on yourself. The healing skill <Skill name="We heal as one"/> also allows you to extend boons on yourself.
- <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr"/> and <Skill name="Signet of the hunt"/> in combination with the <Item id="85244"/> allows you to move extremely fast and is useful for a few skips. Check the [Fractal Guides](/fractals) for specific skips. Superspeed will also override the speed decrease when carrying treasure in [Siren's Reef](/fractals/sirens-reef).

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>
<Warning>

Golem rotations from raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason you can find a video below with openers for each of the CM bosses:

Your other train lines remain the same as on land. The reason for swapping traits here is to provide a 10% damage increase and cooldown reduction on spear skills.

### Underwater Rotation

For a DPS rotation the same rules apply as above land, try to fit lots of damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/> and <Skill name="One wolf pack"/> and line your burst up with <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

You want to start on Harpoon gun and use <Skill id="12528"/> (Harpoon Gun 3) and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> (Harpoon Gun 4) to precast damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/>. 

During the fight, you want to camp Spear since <Skill name="Man o war"/> (Spear 5), <Skill name="Swirling Strike"/> (Spear 2), as well as your auto-attack chain deals good damage. You should swap back to Harpoon gun at the start of the split-phase of the Jellyfish Beast to range the split adds as well as allow you to restart your rotation when the split-phase ends.

**Bonus Tips:**

- If you know that a blockable attack is coming then be sure to use <Skill name="Counterstrike"/> (Skill 4) since you can proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> for a nice 10% damage bonus.
- At the end of a phase you can use <Skill id="12528"/> (Harpoon 3) and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> (Harpoon 4) again.
- You can use <Skill name="Surging maw"/> to quickly reach or come back from the adds during the Jellyfish fight of [Aquatic Ruins](/fractals/aquatic-ruins).

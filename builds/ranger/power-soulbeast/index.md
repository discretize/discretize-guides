<Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills. Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv).

For prestacking and encounters where the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> plays <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> or <Specialization name="guardian"/>, it is beneficial to bring <Skill name="moa stance"/> to is it hot iextend the uptime of boons, especially <Boon name="quickness"/>.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

It can be easier to just use a ring with 3 <Item id="49438"/> in order to reach 245 Agony Resistance so you can share 1 ring between <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> and <Specialization name="Weaver"/> and use full zerk on both.

<GridItem sm="7">
<Card title="Guide">
The main idea of <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> (as with all classes) is to ensure you get as much damage into the <Effect name="exposed"/> buff. As your largest damage skill you want to ensure that <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> under the effects of <Skill name="Sicem"/> is your first priority when you see <Effect name="exposed"/> on the boss. 

Also as <Specialization name="soulbeast"/> you have quite a few ticking damage over time AoEs, such as <Skill name="Barrage"/> and <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> (as well as <Skill id="5531"/> if you have <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="weaver"/>). You want to precast these AoEs where possible when you know that the boss is about to be <Effect name="exposed"/>. 

In PuGs, however, it is quite hard to predict when the boss will be CCed as well as phases can last a lot longer than expected, because of this the golem rotation is listed to the right so that you can resort back to it if you end up in a longer phase.

**Weapon Skills:**
- **You should always run main-hand sword as it offers higher burst potential than dagger in all situations.** It also offers nice movement skills: <Skill name="Monarchs leap"/> and <Skill name="Hornet sting"/>.
- As a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> you want to always run offhand axe as it grants you access to <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>, your highest damage skill, as well as <Skill id="12638"/>, a useful pull skill for adds.

For your second weapon set you either run greatsword or longbow:
- Greatsword is the default pick for the <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> as it offers great sustained DPS. You need to be smart about utilizing the <Effect name="attackofopportunity"/> effect that you gain from <Skill id="12525"/>. Finally, you also have <Skill name="Counterattack"/> which is a handy block in certain scenarios.
- Longbow has a higher burst potential through the ability to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> which is high damage ticking AoE however you will end up with lower damage if your phases are too long since its auto attacks are very weak. Longbow synergizes well with <Item id="84505"/> which you can proc for a nice damage bonus. 
- In order to proc <Item id="84505"/> you merely need to use any CC skill (such as <Skill id="45743"/> or <Skill id="12511"/>) whilst the enemy is using an ability.

**Pets:**
- For pets you simply run <Skill id="43636" disableText/> [Rock Gazelle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Rock_Gazelle) if you need CC or <Skill id="44617" disableText/> [Red Moa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Red_Moa) if you don't. **It is safer to just run Gazelle most of the time and only swap to Moa when you are sure you don't need the CC. You never know when a little CC can come in handy!**
- You want to have <Skill id="31568" disableText/> [Smokescale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Smokescale) on swap to have quick access if you need stealth for skips at any point.

**Utility Skills:**
- **You should never swap out <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> or <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> as they are both massive damage buffs both personally and for the team!**
- You want to always run <Skill name="Sicem"/> as it grants you a **40% damage bonus** for its duration. One thing to keep in mind is that it only grants you a 40% damage bonus against the foe you use it on, so if you are cleaving trash mobs it might not be worth using. Secondly, you only get the buff if you are in <Skill id="42944"/> so also don't activate it if you are unmerged. 
- Your default second utility is <Skill name="Signet of the wild"/> which is a nice passive stat increase. Depending on the situation you can instead run <Skill name="Frost trap"/> which offers higher burst potential. The situations when you want to run trap depend upon phase length and downtime on phases where the trap can recharge.
  - For example on Skorvald you can use <Skill name="Frost trap"/> at the start of each phase into <Effect name="exposed"/> since it recharges during the island phase so the trap is an obvious pick over signet.
- Most healing skills on ranger are quite useful: <Skill name="We heal as one"/> is a large heal and extends the boons on yourself thanks to <Skill id="42944"/>. Secondly <Skill name="Bear stance"/> is a great condi cleanse either personally or for your team. Finally <Skill name="Troll unguent"/> is a ticking heal that can be useful for pushing orbs at Arkk to enter the damage field.

**Extra Notes:**
- <Trait name="Essence of speed"/> in combination with <Trait name="Live fast"/> means that using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> extends your boons, this can be helpful in Ensolyss split phase to maintain boons on yourself. The healing skill <Skill name="We heal as one"/> also allows you to extend boons on yourself.
- <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr"/> in combination with the <Item id="85244"/> allows you to move extremely fast and is useful for a few skips. Check the [Fractal Guides](/fractals) for specific skips.

<Card title="Underwater Guide">

For a DPS rotation the same rules apply as above land, try to fit lots of damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/> and <Skill name="One wolf pack"/>. You want to start on Harpoon gun and use <Skill id="12528"/> and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> to precast damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/>. Outside of that precasting, you want to camp Spear since <Skill name="Man o war"/>, <Skill name="Swirling Strike"/> as well as your auto-attack chain deal good damage. You should swap back to Harpoon gun at the start of the split-phase of the Jellyfish Beast to range the split adds as well as allowing you to restart your rotation when the split-phase ends.

Underwater the pet you use for DPS depends on the situation just like above land:
- You want to merge with <Skill id="44514" disableText/> [Tiger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Tiger) for DPS as well as <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime. You want to use <Skill id="40625"/> and <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> for DPS on Tiger, additionally during DPS downtime (The split phase of the Jellyfish Beast) you want to unmerge and use <Skill id="31451"/> to help your teams <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime.
- If you don't need the <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime then you can consider using <Skill id="43068" disableText/> [Lashtail Devourer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Lashtail_Devourer) as a DPS pet. You want to use <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> for DPS as well as <Skill id="43068"/> off cd so that you proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> for a nice 10% damage bonus.
- Finally when you want to move around very fast then you can merge with <Skill id="42797" disableText/> [Shark](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Shark) for mobility. You simply use <Skill id="42797"/> to move around. **Be careful when you swap pets since you can no longer pet swap in combat!**

**Bonus Tips:**
- <Skill name="Bear stance"/> in combination with <Trait name="leader of the pack"/> can be quite helpful to cleanse conditions on allies since [Aquatic Ruins](/fractals/aquatic-ruins) often has <Instability name="Afflicted"/>. 
- If you know that a blockable attack is coming then be sure to use <Skill name="Counterstrike"/> since you can proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> for a nice 10% damage bonus.

In faster kills you want to run <Item id="82876"/> instead of <Item id="24615"/> on longbow.

**Precast**  
- Remember to share <Skill name="Moastance"/> and blast <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Callofthewild"/>. 
- Pick up the <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>.
- You want to double share <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> with <Trait id="2128"/> (once at the mistlock and once as you run or <Item id="78978"/> to the boss) before swapping to <Trait id="2143"/> before you get in combat.
- Make sure to summon <Skill id="12497"/> before you precast <Skill id="5531"/> and <Skill name="Barrage"/> on MAMA.

**Opening**

- <Skill name="Sicem"/> as soon as MAMA is vulnerable.
- <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> to proc <Item id="84505"/>.
- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="Path of scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling defense"/>.

**1st Add**
- Help CCing with <Skill id="45743"/>.
- Autoattack as well as using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> and <Skill id="41524"/>.

**2nd Phase**

- When you go back back to MAMA, autoattack on sword/axe. You can use <Skill name="Monarchs leap"/> to jump back to MAMA if you want.
- <Skill name="Path of scars"/> when it is off cd. 
- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> to proc <Item id="84505"/>.
- <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/>.
- <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> to summon the frost spirit into the bubble.
- You can start walking to the 2nd add spawn and longbow auto-attacking once the bubble attack has completed. 

**2nd Add**
- Help CCing with <Skill id="45743"/>.
- Precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> to hit MAMA and the add.
- Use a mix of <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/> and autoattacks to kill the add.

**3rd Phase**

- <Skill name="Sicem"/>.
- <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> to CC and proc <Item id="84505"/>.
- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="Path of scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling defense"/>.
- Once MAMA hits 25% you can use <Skill name="Monarchs Leap"/> for a free leap away from the poison field and get to the add faster.

**3rd Add**  
- Resummon your <Skill id="12497"/> as it has probably died by now.
- Swap weapons as soon as it is off cd (<Skill name="Path of scars"/> if you can before swapping). 
- Autoattack as well as using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> and <Skill id="41524"/>.

**4th Phase**
- Try to cast <Skill name="Barrage"/> so it doesn't get interrupted by MAMA jumping.
- Use <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> and <Skill id="45743"/> to CC and proc <Item id="84505"/>.
- <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/>.
- Use your DPS skills as soon as they come off cd and don't cry from having to auto-attack on longbow.

**Additional Notes**
- If you don't trust your group to deal DPS in phase 2 then you can take <Trait id="2128"/> and use <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> when you return to MAMA in phase 2. 
  - This is because in phase 1, 3 and 4 you have the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/> since MAMAs breakbar is broken in these phases but in phase 2 you don't have as many damage modifiers so <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> can help the team phase MAMA faster here.

If you are playing with a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> instead of a <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> you want to play <Skill name="Moastance"/> over <Skill name="Frost trap"/>. You simply use <Skill name="Moastance"/> at the beginning of each phase to help your team apply boons.

**Precast**

- Remember to share <Skill name="Moastance"/> and blast <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Callofthewild"/>.
- Pick up the <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>, then share <Skill name="One wolf pack"/> and finally take the mistlock and run to the boss.
- Summon <Skill id ="12497"/> as you run towards the boss orb.

**Opening**

- When the red circle appears around the arena cast <Skill id="5531"/> and then <Skill name="Barrage"/>.
- <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="Pointblankshot"/> for instant CC. Start casting <Skill id="45743"/> just before Ensolyss becomes vulnerable so you can hit both CC skills.
- <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>, <Skill name="sicem"/> and <Skill name="rapidfire"/>.
- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="pathofscars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/>.
- <Skill name="worldlyimpact"/>.
- Autoattack until your <Skill name="pathofscars"/> is off cd.
- If it isn't phased yet swap weapons and use <Skill name="rapidfire"/>.

**Orb Phases**

- At the beginning of the orb phase make sure to give <Skill name="Moastance"/> to your <Specialization name="renegade"/> so they can share <Boon name="alacrity"/>.
- Use <Skill name="We heal as one"/> and <Skill name="worldlyimpact"/> to keep up <Boon name="alacrity"/> on yourself. 
- Pick up the <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/> (this will only happen during one of the orb phases).

**66% and 33%**  

- Use <Skill name="Moastance"/> and <Skill name="cold snap"/> as your team is gathering in the middle to give boons.
- <Skill id="5531"/> if available and <Skill name="Barrage"/>.
- <Skill id="45743"/> and <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> to CC. 
- <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>, <Skill name="sicem"/>.
- <Skill name="rapidfire"/> then <Skill name="worldlyimpact"/>.
- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="pathofscars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/>.
- Autoattack until your <Skill name="pathofscars"/> is off cd.
- If it isn't phased (or dead) yet swap weapons and use <Skill name="rapidfire"/>.

**Additional Note**

- If you find that you end up back on longbow because the phases are very long then you can swap <Item id="24868"/> for <Item id="24615"/> in your longbow.

Your third utility slot is different for each <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, one should run <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> and the other takes <Skill name="Moastance"/>.

**Both <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>s want to run <Trait name="Clarion Bond"/> in order to blast <Boon name="Might"/> after the orb phase.**

**Precast**

- Place a <Item id="78978"/> portal next to the mistlock and then run over to the boss platform, both <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>s can precast <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> on the boss like a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> in disguise. After that wait for your <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="berserker"/> to start casting their last banner, summon your <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> and open the portal.
- Remember to share <Skill name="Moastance"/> and blast <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Callofthewild"/>.

**Opening**

- When the red circle appears around the arena cast <Skill name="Barrage"/>.
- <Skill name="Frost trap"/>.

- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="pathofscars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/>.

- Autoattack until your <Skill name="pathofscars"/> is off cd.

**Orb Phases**

- At the beginning of the orb phase make sure to give <Skill name="Moastance"/> to your <Specialization name="renegade"/> so they can share <Boon name="alacrity"/> to both <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>s.
- You want to leave <Skill id="42944"/> so that it is back off cd and you can blast <Boon name="Might"/> after the orb phase.
- Use <Skill name="We heal as one"/> and <Skill name="worldlyimpact"/> to top up <Boon name="alacrity"/> on yourself if possible.

**66% and 33%**  

- Use <Skill name="Moastance"/> and <Skill name="cold snap"/> as your team is gathering in the middle to give boons.
- Enter <Skill id="42944"/> to blast <Boon name="Might"/> thanks to <Trait name="Clarion Bond"/>.

You can swap <Item id="24868"/> for <Item id="24661"/> in your longbow if you want.

<Message>
Spirit Management:
- This depends on how your <Specialization name ="Renegade"/> plays, if they precast <Skill id="45686"/> before Skorvald spawns then you can summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down on the boss platform after the precast and the Kalla heal skill will sustain it until the second phase. In this scenario you don't teleport it at all you just leave it behind.
- If they don't do this then you will want to summon the spirit next to the Boss Challenge Mote and let it tick down in health for a couple of ticks and then pull it firstly down to Skorvald after the precast and then to the first island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> in order to kill it so it is back up for island 4 to be resummoned. This is the method described in the guide below.

</Message>

**Precast**
- When you are activating the Boss Challenge Mote run down to the boss platform and precast <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> on the boss like a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> in disguise. Then /gg and wait up by the Mote until you are ready to precast.
- When you are ready to precast summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> next to the Mote then run down and begin precasting with your party. Remember to share <Skill name="Moastance"/> and blast <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Callofthewild"/>.
- Pick up the <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>, then share <Skill name="One wolf pack"/> and finally take the mistlock.
- Use <Skill id="5697"/> (Fiery Greatsword skill 3) to get down to the platform, teleport your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down to the platform then precast <Skill id="5531"/>, <Skill name="Barrage"/> and swap to sword/axe.

**Opening**

- When your first <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> procs cast it again and use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/>.
- <Skill name="pathofscars"/> then when Skorvald is targetable, use <Skill name="Sicem"/> and <Skill id="45743"/> (to CC).
- <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/> into <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Hornet Sting"/> to get to the first island once it is phased.

**Islands**  
- Call <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> to the 1st island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> and use <Skill name="Worldlyimpact"/> and autoattacks to kill the add.
- You can use <Skill name="whirlingdefense"/> on the 2nd one after it jumps.
- Swap to longbow and kill the 3rd add with <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> and <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/>.
- Resummon <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> on the last island. Take the portal early to teleport <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> to you and to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> before Skorvald becomes vulnerable.

**66% and 33%**

- <Skill name="Frosttrap"/>, <Skill name="Sicem"/>.
- **Don't use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/> in phase 2 unless you don't think you'll make the dps check.**
- Do use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/> in phase 3.
- <Skill name="pathofscars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/>.

**Additional Note**
- Warhorn can be a replacement for Longbow here, <Skill name="Callofthewild"/> is a blast finisher allowing you to stack <Boon name="Might"/> on the islands. You simply use <Skill id="12620"/> before you start attacking in each phase.

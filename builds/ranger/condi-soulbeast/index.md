<Message>
This build is [META](/guides/meta-explained) in full condi groups. In power groups this build will fall massively behind <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/> - the power damage counterpart.
</Message>


Condi <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with high sustained damage and reasonable burst that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, and crowd control (CC) skills. This build is mostly used for 100CM, for most other fractals, especially if your group are playing power builds, you will be better off playing the power variant found [here](/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast/).


This build is rather self sufficient due to:
- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/> 
- Good CC with <Skill id="46432"/> and <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="Instinctive Engage"/> and <Skill name="Quick Shot"/>

Overall this is a very well rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

<Message>
This build is probably only worth running in a static group. It's damage depends on the amount of <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Soulbeasts"/> in the party. The build deals similar DPS with 2 condi Soulbeasts, and outperforms the Krait build if you have 3 Soulbeasts in the party. If you are going to be on your own run the Krait rune setup!

<Card title="Shortbow vs Axe/Dagger">
Although Axe/Dagger benches higher, typically this build is only run in 100CM where Shortbow shines due to the amount of moving Ai does. This allows you to keep attacking while at range. If you are running this build elsewhere you will probably find that Axe/Dagger with <Trait name="Quickdraw"/> will do more DPS. Although in situations with short phases such as Ensolyss where you can keep a high <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> uptime along with the 100% modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/> you will find that Shortbow is still better.
</Card>
<Card title="Off-hand Dagger">
Running an off-hand Dagger is slightly more DPS than running Torch providing you can flank permanently and your group can't make use of the fire field from <Skill name="Bonfire"/>. It also has the benefit of having an evade through using <Skill id="12478"/>.

<Card title="Information">
When playing <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Condi Soulbeast"/> in 100CM, <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> is much more attractive choice than <Trait name="Quickdraw"/> which is used in raids. The reason being that Ai moves around far too much for you to be able to benefit from using skills like <Skill name="Bonfire"/> twice in most cases. Also with some strategic dodging during movement and downtime you can keep a very high <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> uptime especially during your bursts which leads to very high DPS.

The rotation in general is very simple, just keep rotating between your Shortbow and Dagger/Torch set using your utility skills as often as you can. When you get to the point of auto attacking use your <Skill id="42944"/> skills to fill.

1. If you can get in combat briefly stack <Item id="24609"/> and <Item id="24599"/>
2. While in combat you can precast <Trait name="Poison MAster"/> by using a <Skill id="42944"/> ability.
2. <Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> while merged with Bristleback then swap to your desired pet and enter <Skill id="42944"/> (If you are staying with Bristleback you can cast <Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> a second time after taking the _Mistlock Singularity_)
3. With <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> selected, use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> and dodge twice.

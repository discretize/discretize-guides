The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge"/> is an easy build to learn and provides access to good off-support tools (large amounts of passive barrier from <Trait id="2059"/>) and can be augmented to provide the means of a safety net at an acceptable amount of DPS loss with the Blood Magic trait line (without any stat changes). The build can place lots of conditions and crowd control on multiple targets simultaneously with its shades and <Skill name="Epidemic"/>. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> in combination with its other tools, it is quite self-substantial.

The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge" /> has multiple offensive control
skill options, like using <Control name="Pull" />, corrupt boons for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, cause conditions like <Condition name="Blinded" /> and <Condition name="Immobile" />
, etc. <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge" /> and can modify
itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

This build also does not have a formal rotation and instead has a prioritization for its skills making it easy to focus on side objectives and quickly pick up where you left off in dealing damage.

Due to being a condition-based build, it will not benefit as highly from slaying potions or <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as much as power builds.

Situational Runes:

- <Item id="24688"/> can be purchased from the trading post and are a minor DPS loss compared to <Item id="24848"/>
- <Item id="83502" /> works best for using and utilizing <Skill name="Epidemic" />, as its damage will be maximized with this rune. Note that you will have a loss of condition duration with this rune choice.

### Situational Traits

Running Blood Magic instead of Soul Reaping can be an option if you need more team revival power via <Trait name="Ritual of Life"/> and <Trait name="Transfusion"/> and more sustain in general. It will cause a personal damage loss but it can be helpful if your party is having trouble staying alive.

<Warning>
Taking <Trait name="Banshees Wail"/> will bring some more CC via the warhorn skill <Skill name="Wail of Doom"/>.

| <Skill name="Epidemic" size="big" disableText/>               | Spreads conditions on your current target to up to 5 enemies in the surrounding area. Particularly useful on mob heavy T4s and also Arkk CM, where it can be used to kill the Anomaly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| <Skill name="Spectral Grasp" size="big" disableText/>         | A useful 1200 range 5 target <Control name="Pull"/> to help stack up golems at the [Chaos](/fractals/chaos) Anomaly fight or the adds in the Arkk (see [Shattered Observatory](/fractals/shattered-observatory)) fight. It also provides an extra 150 defiance bar damage. Hits up to five times if you cast it inside a mob with other enemies outside.                                                          |
| <Skill name="Summon Flesh Golem" size="big" disableText/>     | Can be taken if your group needs additional CC at the cost of a small DPS loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <Skill name="Summon Bone Minions" size="big" disableText/>    | If your group has more than one Necromancer (though this benefits Scourge a lot more) take this to provide Life Force for all Necromancer players for far more overall gain (summon and detonate off cooldown). Bone Minions can also work well if a target is highly mobile or you have frequent downtime where haunt can not be used on a target (e.g. Light Phase Ai in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak)). |
| <Skill name="Corrupt Boon" size="big" disableText/>           | A strong boon corrupt which can be used to boon rip on days with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| <Skill name="Summon Flesh Wurm" size="big" disableText/>      | A 1200 range teleport skill that can also work as a projectile blocker for fights like Old Tom in the [Uncategorized](/fractals/uncategorized) fractal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <Skill name="Spectral Walk " size="big" disableText/>         | A secondary teleport skill that allows one to solo the turret room in the [Thaumanova](/fractals/thaumanova-reactor) fractal. Also great for consuming conditions on consoles in the [Aetherblade](/fractals/aetherblade) fractal.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <Skill name="Trail of Anguish" size="big" disableText/>       | A go-to stunbreak skill for Scourge, that can also provide some decent conditions if you step in and out of your targets hitbox to proc it multiple times. Also works as a Punishment skill and has synergy with <Trait name="Sadistic Searing"/>.                                                                                                                                                                |
| <Skill name="Corrosive Poison Cloud" size="big" disableText/> | A useful skill for mitigating projectiles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <Skill name="Signet of Vampirism" size="big" disableText/>    | This can provide you a minor dps increase in situations where barrier application is not needed. If you are using <Skill name="Signet of Vampirism"/> and no other Punishment skill, you can take <Trait name="Desert Empowerment"/> over <Trait name="Sadistic Searing"/>.                                                                                                                                       |
| <Skill name="Sand Swell" size="big" disableText/>             | A useful skill that allows you to double up on blinks. Also works as a Punishment skill and has synergy with <Trait name="Sadistic Searing"/>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Skill Priority

**Precasting:**

You can pre-emptively cast some shades before a fight starts to begin ramping up the benefits from <Trait name="Sand Sage"/>. <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> can be precasted for the increased damage modifier and to transfer the conditions from <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> as the first cast of the fight.

**Prioritization: [Weapon/Utility Skills]**

Always use this skill off-cooldown, even if it means interrupting auto-attack chains:

1. <Skill name="Feast of Corruption" /> (Scepter 3)

Use after finishing your current auto-attack chain:

2. <Skill name="Harrowing Wave"/> (Torch 4)
3. <Skill name="Grasping Dead"/> (Scepter 2)
4. <Skill name="Oppressive Collapse"/> (Torch 5)
5. <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> (Utility) (combo this with <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/>)
6. <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> (F1)

**Shade Skills**

While you perform the above prioritization, you'll be using your shade skills to get additional applications of <Condition name="Burning"/> (from <Trait name="Dhuumfire"/>) and <Condition name="Torment"/>. If you can ensure that you have enough Life Force to cast <Skill name="Nefarious Favor"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> at all times, you can use any excess Life Force with the following prioritization:

1. <Skill name="Nefarious Favor" />
2. <Skill name="Sand Cascade" />
3. <Skill name="Garish Pillar" />

### Notes

- If you're using <Skill name="Summon Shadow Fiend"/>, you should use <Skill name="Haunt"/> off cooldown as it has no cast time.
- You want to combo <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> together to take advantage of <Trait name="Plague Sending"/>. Use <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> as you cast <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> to ensure you transfer the right conditions (the self caused <Condition name="Bleeding"/> and <Condition name="Torment"/> from <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> specifically).
- While you want to maintain 3 shades up, you still want to focus on the rest of the skill prioritization as the wasted cooldown time outweighs the minor loss of Expertise.
- Casting your <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> on the group will provide large amounts of barrier passively through your rotation. They can also be used on other significant targets such as the Anomalies in the [Shattered Observatory](/fractals/shattered-observatory) fractal. A <Specialization name="Scourge"/> counts as a shade activator itself and will also hit any targets within the range of your shade abilities.
- If your group has three (or more) Scourges, you can all take <Skill name="Summon Bone Minions"/> and replace <Skill name="Signet of Undeath"/> with a different utility skill of choice (provided all Scourges use their <Skill name="Putrid Explosion"/> skill off cooldown).
- Your <Trait name="Dhuumfire"/> trait has an internal cooldown of one second. Be sure to space out your shade skills (including <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/>) instead of blindly spamming them off cooldown.

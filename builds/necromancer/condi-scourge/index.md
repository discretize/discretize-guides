The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge"/> is an easy build to learn and provides access to good off-support tools and can be augmented to provide the means of a safety net at an acceptable amount of DPS loss with the Blood Magic traitline (without any stat changes). The build can place lots of conditions and crowd control on multiple targets simultaneously with its shades and <Skill name="Epidemic"/>. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> in combination with its other tools, it is quite self-substantial.

<Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge" /> has multiple offensive control
skill options, like using <Control name="Pull" />, corrupt boons for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, cause conditions like <Condition name="Blinded" /> and <Condition name="Immobile" />
, etc. <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge" /> and can modify
itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

This build also does not have a formal rotation, and instead has a prioritization for its skills making it easy to focus on side objectives and quickly pick up where you left off in dealing damage.

Due to being a condition based build, it will not benefit as highly from slaying potions or <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as much as power builds.

| <Skill name="Summon Flesh Golem" size="big" disableText/>     | Can be taken if your group needs additional CC at the cost of a small DPS loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <Skill name="Summon Bone Minions" size="big" disableText/>    | If your group has more than one Necromancer (though this benefits Scourge a lot more) take this to provide Life Force for all Necromancer players for far more overall gain (summon and detonate off cooldown). Bone Minions can also work well if a target is highly mobile or you have frequent downtime where haunt can not be used on a target (e.g. Light Phase Ai in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak)). |
| <Skill name="Corrupt Boon" size="big" disableText/>           | A strong boon corrupt which can be used to boon rip on days with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| <Skill name="Summon Flesh Wurm" size="big" disableText/>      | A 1200 range teleport skill that can also work as a projectile blocker for fights like Old Tom in the [Uncategorized](/fractals/uncategorized) fractal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <Skill name="Spectral Walk " size="big" disableText/>         | A secondary teleport skill that allows one to solo the turret room in the [Thaumanova](/fractals/thaumanova-reactor) fractal. Also great for consuming conditions on consoles in the [Aetherblade](/fractals/aetherblade) fractal.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <Skill name="Spectral Grasp" size="big" disableText/>         | A useful 1200 range 5 target <Control name="Pull"/> to help stack up golems at the [Chaos](/fractals/chaos) Anomaly fight or the adds in the Arkk (see [Shattered Observatory](/fractals/shattered-observatory)) fight. It also provides an extra 150 defiance bar damage. Hits up to five times if you cast it inside a mob with other enemies outside.                                                          |
| <Skill name="Trail of Anguish" size="big" disableText/>       | A go-to stunbreak skill for Scourge, that can also provide some decent conditions if you step in and out of your targets hitbox to proc it multiple times. Also works as a Punishment skill and has synergy with <Trait name="Sadistic Searing"/>.                                                                                                                                                                |
| <Skill name="Corrosive Poison Cloud" size="big" disableText/> | A useful skill for mitigating projectiles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <Skill name="Signet of Vampirism" size="big" disableText/>    | This can provide you a minor dps increase in situations where barrier application is not needed. If you are using <Skill name="Signet of Vampirism"/> and no other Punishment skill, you can take <Trait name="Desert Empowerment"/> over <Trait name="Sadistic Searing"/>.                                                                                                                                       |
| <Skill name="Sand Swell" size="big" disableText/>             | A useful skill that allows you to double up on blinks. Also works as a Punishment skill and has synergy with <Trait name="Sadistic Searing"/>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

<Card title="Blood Magic">

Running Blood Magic instead of Soul Reaping can be an option if you really need more team revival power via <Trait name="Ritual of Life"/> and <Trait name="Transfusion"/> and more sustain in general. It will cause a personal damage loss but it can be helpful if your party is having trouble staying alive.

<Card title="Skill Prioritization">

**Precasting:**

You can pre-emptively cast some shades before a fight starts to begin ramping up the benefits from <Trait name="Sand Sage"/>.

**Prioritization: [Weapon/Utility Skills]**

Always use this skill off-cooldown, even if it means interrupting auto-attack chains:

1. <Skill name="Feast of Corruption" /> (Scepter 3)

Use after finishing your current auto-attack chain: 2. <Skill name="Harrowing Wave"/> (Torch 4) 3. <Skill name="Grasping Dead"/> (Scepter 2) 4. <Skill name="Oppressive Collapse"/> (Torch 5) 5. <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> (Utility) (combo this with <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/>) 6. <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> (F1)

**Shade Skills**

While you perform the above prioritization, you'll be using your shade skills to get additional applications of <Condition name="Burning"/> (from <Trait name="Dhuumfire"/>) and <Condition name="Torment"/>. If you can ensure that you have enough Life Force to cast <Skill name="Nefarious Favor"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> at all times, you can use any excess Life Force with the following prioritization:

1. <Skill name="Nefarious Favor" />
2. <Skill name="Sand Cascade" />
3. <Skill name="Garish Pillar" />

</Card>

</GridItem>

<GridItem sm="5">
<Card title="Notes:">

- If you're using <Skill name="Summon Shadow Fiend"/>, you should use <Skill name="Haunt"/> off cooldown as it has no cast time.
- You want to combo <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> together to take advantage of <Trait name="Plague Sending"/>. Use <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> as you cast <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> to ensure you transfer the right conditions (the self caused <Condition name="Bleeding"/> and <Condition name="Torment"/> from <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> specifically).
- While you want to maintain 3 shades up, you still want to focus on the rest of the skill prioritization as the wasted cooldown time outweighs the minor loss of Expertise.
- Be sure to place shades on significant targets: A <Specialization name="Scourge"/> itself counts as a shade activator, and will already hit your primary target with shade abilities from your character. (For example, place them on Anomalies in the [Shattered Observatory](/fractals/shattered-observatory) fractal)
- If your group has three (or more) Scourges, you can all take <Skill name="Summon Bone Minions"/> and replace <Skill name="Signet of Undeath"/> with a different utility skill of choice (provided all Scourges use their <Skill name="Putrid Explosion"/> skill off cooldown).
- Your <Trait name="Dhuumfire"/> trait has an internal cooldown of one second. Be sure to space out your shade skills (including <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/>) instead of blindly spamming them off cooldown.

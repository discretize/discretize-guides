Though their two builds are similar enough to swap between easily, <Specialization name="reaper" prefix="Condition"/> will most likely fair better in fractals than <Specialization name="scourge" prefix="condition"/> due to Reaper having the superior burst damage (though if you’re dealing with a lot of mobs like in the [Molten Boss Fractal](https://discretize.eu/fractals/molten-boss) it may be worth swapping to Scourge for the superior cleave).

Offering a good mix of damage, CC and utility this build can adapt well to fit most situations you’ll come across in fractals, though it is held back a bit by the reliance on hitting ice fields for a significant part of your rotation; as well as being a condition build in a power-burst oriented part of the game; but it also comes back strong with good baseline survivability as well as amazing sustain you can trait in for emergencies (or to enable a cushier/more aggressive playstyle).

Beyond the requirement of understanding combo field attunement, <Specialization name="reaper" prefix="condition"/> is a satisfying build that is a good mix of rewarding and relatively uncomplicated, in addition to not relying on allied support to stay alive in key situations as other builds, though it does have a lower damage potential compared to them as well (partly due to being a condi build of course). This build is recommended for situations where boon corruption may be needed for the team, extra forms of projectile mitigation are required, or short bursts of cleave via <Skill id="10606"/> are desired (and can also allow you to solo/carry most fractals should you gain enough mastery over it).

Tips & skill usage
</CardHeader>
<CardContent>
- Try to avoid cancelling your auto attack chain, especially if your opponents have boons of any kind
- The most damaging part of your rotation is the “Shroud Combo”, make sure you’re entering the ice field generated by <Skill id="30557"/> before any other combo field to ensure you get those Chilling Bolts
- Also keep in mind that if you know when a fight like Skorvold or Arkk will start you can precast <Skill id="10590"/>, <Skill id="10549"/> and <Skill id="30557"/> to make sure you get as much damage out of your opening burst as possible.
- When using <Skill id="10606"/>, try to cast it off of targets with the most conditions. Otherwise, it's better to target the weaker enemy in a group with it to ensure you get more damage out of the resulting conditions on the tougher targets.
- <Skill id="29855"/> is a great way to mitigate a lot of damage from mobs by utilizing the numerous <Condition name="blind"/>s it applies, especially when combined with <Skill id="29740"/> to stack them all up beforehand.
- If you’re having Life Force issues you can sneak in a <Skill id="30860"/> both before and after leaving <Skill id="30792"/>
- While you can utilize <Skill id="30792"/> to mitigate damage don’t rely on it too much, having no Life Force equates to a large drop in damage due to being unable to complete your shroud combo.

The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Celestial Alacrity Scourge"/> is an easy build to learn and provides excellent support in the form of barrier, <Boon name="might"/>, <Condition name="vulnerability"/> and crowd control.
The build is not locked to any utility skill, you should pick and choose depending on what your party may need. For example, you may swap out <Skill name="Desiccate"/> if you don't have to cover fury, <Skill name="Trail of Anguish"/> if you don't need the <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Skill name="Serpent Siphon"/> if you can't make use of the <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

### Shade Skills

In order to utilize shade-skills you either place a shade onto your target or stay within 180 range yourself.

- Maintain at least 1 shade at all times.
- Using your shade skills will add additional applications of <Condition name="Torment"/> and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> (from <Trait name="Unyielding Blast"/>). 
- The standard setup will allow you to spam all shade skills on cooldown.
- <Skill name="Nefarious Favor"/> will convert one condition on allies to a boon.

- <Skill name="Garish Pillar"/> will apply 2 seconds of <Condition name="Fear"/>, heal, teleport to you and partially revive downed allies through <Trait name="Transfusion"/>.

- Additionally shade effects do not stack, they only expand the area in which they get applied.

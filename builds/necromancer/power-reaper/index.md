The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and damage mitigation, it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> has multiple offensive skill
options (<Control name="Pull" />, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, <Condition name="Blinded" />, <Condition name="Immobile" />, etc.) <Specialization
  name="Reaper" 
  text="Power Reaper"
/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

Using this setup is a damage increase on encounters where you don't benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

This gearset can be optimised slightly using <Item id="37132"/>. Use the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your gear!

### Situational Weapons

- Staff: used for precasting and cleave damage. 

Playing Staff over Dagger at single target encounters is not bad, but recognize that <Skill name="Life Siphon" /> (Dagger 2) continues during your shroud and therefore takes advantage of <Trait name="Death Perception"/>. 

-> Staff will fall behind in fast groups!

- Warhorn: when it comes to break bar damage <Skill name="Oppressive Collapse" /> (Torch 5) is simply a better version of <Skill name="Wail of Doom" /> (Warhorn 4), but <Skill name="Locust Swarm" /> (Warhorn 5) can be precasted for a long uptime of your Fireworks relic.
This can be useful during downtimes e.g. Arkk.
- Focus: can be used during days with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" /> to generate a damage increase by stripping boons with  <Skill name="Spinal Shivers" /> (Focus 5), but generally speaking <Skill name="Well of Corruption" /> (Utility) or <Skill name="Corrupt Boon" /> (Utility) can be used on both weaponsets and do not require adjusting your gear.

### Precasting

- Staff marks if possible
- Use <Skill name="Lich Form"/> (Elite) to precast <Skill id="10636"/> (Skill 4).
- If you have <Skill name="Mistfire Wolf" /> (Deluxe Upgrade) precast it on encounters that are too far away from the _Mistlock Singularity_ to make use of your Lich precast.
- Alternativly <Skill name="Spectral Walk"/> can be used before taking a portal to precast your <Skill id="10636"/> and still being able to take the _Mistlock Singularity_.
- Optional: Precast <Skill name="Rise" /> (Utility) and swap back to your combat skills.

### Notes

The given rotation below is meant for a golem-like scenario and has to be adapted based on phase-lengths/exposed/mechanics/the following aspects: 

- Take into account exposed/impact burst windows! 
- Since most fractal phases are on a faster pace, you might have to use your <Skill name="Soul Spiral" /> (Shroud 4) earlier. 
- <Skill name="Deaths Charge" /> (Shroud 2) deals a decent chunk of its damage at the end of the cast, so it can be beneficial to skip it towards the end of a phase.
- All shouts require to stand in melee range (240 range) to get their full value.
- <Skill name="Infusing Terror" /> (first instance of shroud 3) should always be utilised during shroud to prevent getting interrupted and to reduce the loss of Life Force from incomming damage for 6s. 
Keep in mind that <Skill name="Terrify" /> (second instance of shroud 3) ends the damage mitigation and can interrupt e.g. <Skill name="Soul Spiral" /> (Shroud 4), so be careful to not double cast it by accident.

#### Below 50% hp

- <Trait name="Close to Death"/> increases all of your strike damage.
- <Skill name="Gravedigger"/> (Greatsword 2) has no recharge cooldown anymore.
- Skip <Skill name="Dark Pact"/> (Dagger 3) and Greatsword Auto-Attacks for more Gravdiggers.
- Only use <Skill name="Death Spiral"/> if you need additional Life Force.
- Below 25% boss HP <Skill name="Executioner's Scythe" /> (Shroud 5) deals its highest amount of damage.

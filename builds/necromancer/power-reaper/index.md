The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> build, while not one of the strongest in terms of DPS, is a versatile build that can modify itself to suit a variety of scenarios without many issues.

With two main trait variants (Blood Magic for higher group sustain/CC and revival power; and Soul Reaping for a more powerful rotation and higher <Condition name="vulnerability"/> application) and multiple offensive skill options (<Control name="Pull"/>, boon corruptions, <Condition name="blind"/>, <Control name="Immobile"/>, etc.) <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

This build's weakness is its inability to be healed whilst in shroud, which can also affect your ability to maintain shroud for the rotation of the Soul Reaping variant, this can be offset by anticipating large attacks from bosses and sneaking in usage of <Skill name="Summon Shadow Fiend" disableText/>'s <Skill name="Haunt"/> skill or Greatsword's <Skill name="Death Spiral"/>.

However, large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> will allow this build to perform well as a "solo carry" build that suffers less from underperforming teammates and heavily rewards a skilled user.

* A budget option is to just have individual greatswords with the required slaying sigils until you can get your specialized axes (see [Consumables Guide](/guides/consumables))

<Card title="Rotation">
<Grid>
 Your rotation falls into three main parts:
</Grid>
<GridItem sm="2">
**Greatsword**
-

</GridItem>
This is to be used essentially whenever you're not in <Skill name= "Reapers Shroud"/>

Pre 50% HP
<GridItem sm="10">

1. <Skill name="Grave Digger"/>
2. <Skill name="Death Spiral"/>
3. <Skill name="Dusk Strike"/> => <Skill name="Fading Twilight"/> => <Skill name="Chilling Scythe"/> x 3
4. <Skill name="Grave Digger"/>
5. <Skill name="Death Spiral"/>
6. <Skill name="Nightfall"/>
7. <Skill name="Grasping Darkness"/>
8. Weapon Swap
   </GridItem>

Post 50% HP
<GridItem sm="10">

1. <Skill name="Grave Digger"/> x 9
2. <Skill name="Nightfall"/>
3. <Skill name="Grasping Darkness"/>
4. Weapon Swap
   </GridItem>

## **Axe/Warhorn**

Use this as part of your rotation, but the best time is to be using this as you are about to break a defiance bar (in tandem with the <Skill name= "Reapers Shroud"/> portion of your rotation)
<GridItem sm="10">

1. <Skill name="Ghastly Claws"/>
2. <Skill name="Locust Swarm"/>
3. <Skill name="Well of Suffering"/>
4. <Skill name= "Reapers Shroud"/> (seen below)
5. <Skill name="Ghastly Claws"/>
6. Weapon Swap
   </GridItem>

## **<Skill name= "Reapers Shroud"/>**

Your aim is to use this when you have all of your persistent AoE abilities active (<Skill name="Well of Suffering"/>, <Skill name="Locust Swarm"/>, and <Skill name="Nightfall"/> )
<GridItem sm="10">

1. <Skill name="Soul Spiral"/>
2. <Skill name="Life Rend"/> => <Skill name="Life Slash"/> => <Skill name="Life Reap"/> x 5 (or if you're going to drop below 50% life force)
3. <Skill name= "Reapers Shroud"/> (to leave shroud)
   </GridItem>

</Card>
<Card title="Advanced Notes">
- By utilizing weapon stowing you can get extra damage out of your consecutive <Skill name="Gravedigger"/> uses.
- Always finish your auto-attack chains in both <Skill name="Reapers Shroud"/> and Greatsword.
- Utilize smart positioning for skills like <Skill name="Grasping Darkness"/> and <Skill name="Life Reap"/>, as you gain bonus effects by hitting multiple targets (bonus life force, cooldown reduction for shroud from <Skill name="Life Reap" disableText/>, etc.)
- While you can use shroud as a way to mitigate large amounts of damage, it will result in a 5% dps loss until you can get your life force back up again, as well as locking you out of using shroud.
- <Skill name="Deaths Charge"/> is a fantastic way to get around faster outside of using blink skills.

</Card>

<GridItem sm="5">

<Card title="Opener">
- If able to immediately break the defiance bar
   - Begin in Axe/Warhorn to use precast <Skill name="Locust Swarm"/> for initial damage then <Skill name="Wail of Doom"/> to break bar.
   - As the bar is broken immediately use <Skill name="Well of Suffering"/>, then weapon swap
   - Use <Skill name="Nightfall"/> then <Skill name="Grasping Darkness"/>, then enter <Skill name="Reapers Shroud"/>
   - Use <Skill name="Soul Spiral"/> then continue auto-attack chains until you cannot continue wihtout dropping below 50% Life Force.
   - Continue with the usual rotation.
- If the defiance bar won't be broken immediately (e.g. Ensolyss)
   - Start in Greatsword
   - Use Greatsword Auto-attack chains, <Skill name="Gravedigger"/>, and <Skill name="Death Spiral"/> until the bar is about to be broken
   - As the Defiance bar is about to occur, use <Skill name="Nightfall"/> into <Skill name="Grasping Darkness"/> and then weapon swap to use <Skill name="Wail of Doom"/>
   - As the defiance bar is broken use the following:
   - <Skill name="Locust Swarm"/>
   - <Skill name="Ghastly Claws"/>
   - <Skill name="Reapers Shroud"/>
   - <Skill name="Soul Spiral"/>
   - Then continue the rotation as normal

Note: You can pre-cast <Skill name="Haunt"/> (even if the boss is invulnerable at first) to apply instant <Condition name="Chilled"/> for 10% damage boost.

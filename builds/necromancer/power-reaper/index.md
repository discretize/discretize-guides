The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> has multiple offensive skill
options (<Control name="Pull" />, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, <Condition name="Blinded" />, <Condition name="Immobile" />, etc.) <Specialization
  name="Reaper"
  text="Power Reaper"
/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

- If necessary (usually only in underperforming groups), you can swap out Soul Reaping for Blood Magic (if you need more team revival power via <Trait name="Ritual of Life" /> and <Trait name="Transfusion" />, and if needed more CC via the warhorn skill <Trait name="Banshees Wail" />).

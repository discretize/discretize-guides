    content: >-
      The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best
      picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to
      large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon
      name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> it is good in parties where
      your teammates do not perform very well.


      <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> has multiple offensive skill

      options (<Control name="Pull" />, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />

      , <Condition name="Blinded" />, <Condition name="Immobile" />, etc.) <Specialization
        name="Reaper"
        text="Power Reaper"
      /> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.


      It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

      | <Skill name="Spectral Walk " size="big" disableText/>         | A secondary teleport skill that allows one to solo the turret room in the [Thaumanova Fractal](/fractals/thaumanova-reactor).

      | <Skill name="Spectral Grasp" size="big" disableText/>         | A useful 1200 range 5 target pull to help stack up golems at the Chaos Anomaly fight or the adds in the Arkk fight.

      | <Skill name="Rise!" size="big" disableText/>                  | Swap with <Skill name="Well of Darkness"/> if you need a meat shield at the cost of personal DPS (best use in Siren's Reef and Molten Boss fractals). It is your hardest hitting shout, has no cast time so you can go in shroud faster.             |

      | <Skill name="Summon Shadow Fiend" size="big" disableText/>    | Possible alternative instead of <Skill name="Well of Darkness"/> for longer bosses like Artsariiv, Arkk in the [Shattered Observatory Fractal](/fractals/shattered-observatory) and Ensolyss in the [Nightmare Fractal](/fractals/nightmare).        |

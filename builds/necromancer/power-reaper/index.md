The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and damage mitigation, it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper" /> has multiple offensive skill
options (<Control name="Pull" />, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" />
, <Condition name="Blinded" />, <Condition name="Immobile" />, etc.) <Specialization
  name="Reaper"
  text="Power Reaper"
/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

Situationally on some fights the <Item id="24836"/> setup can be better.

If you want to optimise this build with infusions you can run 14 <Item name="Mighty +9 Agony Infusion"/> and 4 <Item name="Precise +9 Agony Infusion"/>, with a <Item id="48081" text="Berserkers Helm"/>.

In organized play the <Item id="24836"/> setup will outperform the <Item id="24723"/> setup on Skorvald, Arstariiv and the first two phases of Ensolyss.

Besides of cleave in T4 fractals, Arstariiv is the only encounter where it is optimal to play the raid gear with <Item id="24618"/> instead of <Item id="24868"/>.

<Card title="Situational Weapon">

- You can play with Axe/Warhorn on single target encounters with the need of additional defiance bar damage, utilising  <Skill name="Wail of Doom" /> (Warhorn 4).
- On <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" /> encounters Axe/Focus can generate a damage increase by stripping boons with  <Skill name="Spinal Shivers" /> (Focus 5), but generally speaking <Skill name="Corrupt Boon" /> (Utility) can be used on both weaponsets and does not require adjusting the gear.

</Card> 

<Card title="Situational Traits">

- If necessary (usually only in underperforming groups), you can swap out Soul Reaping for Blood Magic (if you need more team revival power via <Trait name="Ritual of Life" /> and <Trait name="Transfusion" />, and if needed more CC via the warhorn skill <Trait name="Banshees Wail" />).

<Card title="Notes:">

- Below 50% boss HP: <Skill name="Gravedigger" /> (Greatsword 2) replaces  <Skill name="Death Spiral" /> (Greatsword 3) and Greatsword auto-attacks. 
 
Cancel the aftercasts with any other skill or weaponswap (shroud works as well) or simply by pressing auto-attack in between two casts.
- Below 25% boss HP: use <Skill name="Executioner's Scythe" /> (Shroud 5).
- All shouts require to stand in melee range (240 range) to get their full value.
- <Skill name="Deaths Charge" /> (Shroud 2) only deals slightly more damage compared to shroud auto-attacks.
- <Skill name="Infusing Terror" /> (first instance of shroud 3) should always be utilised during shroud to prevent getting interrupted and to reduce the loss of life force from incomming damage for 6s. 
Keep in mind that <Skill name="Terrify" /> (second instance of shroud 3) ends the damage mitigation and can interrupt e.g. <Skill name="Soul Spiral" /> (Shroud 4), so be careful to not double cast it by accident.

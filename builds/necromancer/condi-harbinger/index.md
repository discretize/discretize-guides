The <Specialization name="Harbinger" text="Condi Harbinger"/> provides high Condition damage while having some self-generated boons due to Elixirs as well as some group <Boon name="Might"/> through <Skill name="Blood is Power"/>. You can also adapt your build to provide <Boon name="Quickness"/> as well as share your Elixir boons with your group. You can also upkeep 25 stacks of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on your own after the initial ramp-up.

The <Specialization name="Harbinger" text="Condi Harbinger"/> is more squishy than other <Specialization name="Necromancer"/> builds because it loses maximum health due to the <Effect name="Blight"/> mechanic and <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/> does not act as a second health bar. However, even with maximum <Effect name="Blight"/> stacks, you will still be at around 15k health.

Due to being a condition-based build, it will not benefit from slaying potions or <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

If you are unable to keep up Quickness with this build, swap out Viper pieces for Ritualist until you can keep up Quickness on your group. Ritualist pieces are very effective at increasing your boon duration on this build due to <Trait id="2220"/> converting the <Attribute name="Vitality"/> into extra <Attribute name="Concentration"/>.

If you need additional CC, you can freely replace your Dagger on your Scepter set with <Item id="75325"/>  

This build uses the Jade Bot Core: Tier 10 in combination with 9 <Item name="Malign +9 Agony Infusion"/> and 9 <Item name="Spiteful +9 Agony Infusion"/>. However you can also run 15 <Item name="Malign +9 Agony Infusion"/> and 3 <Item name="Spiteful +9 Agony Infusion"/> with <Item id="91876"/>, giving you the same stats.

<Card title="Blight">

- Using Elixir skills and staying in <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/> will inflict <Effect name="Blight"/> on you, reducing your maximum health by 1.5% per stack (up to 37.5% at 25 stacks).
- <Trait name="Septic Corruption"/> increases the damage you deal with conditions for each stack of <Effect name="Blight"/>.
- <Trait name="Alchemic Vigor"/> heals you every second for each stack of <Effect name="Blight"/>.
- Certain skills consume some <Effect name="Blight"/> when you are above a treshold to deal more damage, namely <Skill name="Devouring Cut"/> (Shroud 3) and your Elixirs when above 5 stacks of <Effect name="Blight"/> and <Skill name="Voracious Arc"/> (Shroud 4) when above 10 stacks.

</Card>

<Card title="Pistol skills">

- Your auto-attack <Skill name="Vicious Shot"/> deals good damage and will be used to fill any gaps in the rotation.
- <Skill name="Weeping Shots"/> sends out multiple bullets and fills up Life Force for each bullet that hits an enemy. This skill also pierces which can be useful to help with the anomaly at Arkk as an example.
- <Skill name="Vile Blast"/> fires a dart that, on impact, will explode and give you some Life Force per enemy hit and <Control name="Stun"/> as well as inflict <Condition name="Weakness"/> and <Condition name="Poisoned"/>.

</Card>

<Card title="Harbinger Shroud">

- Unlike on core <Specialization name="Necromancer"/> or <Specialization name="Reaper"/>, your <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/> will not absorb the damage for you while inside.
- You can enter <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/> even at 0 Life Force since entering gives you 15% due to <Trait name="Corrupted Talent"/>.
- While in <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/>, you constantly gain <Effect name="Blight"/> and drain Life Force.
- All of your important Shroud skills are ranged. However, part of your damage comes from <Trait name="Doom Approaches"/> which has a small radius around you. Same goes for <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime through <Trait name="Deathly Haste"/>.
- Your auto-attack <Skill name="Tainted Bolts"/> deals damage around your target.
- <Skill name="Dark Barrage"/> fires out 6 bolts. If you stand too far away, some bolts will miss the target.
- <Skill name="Devouring Cut"/> dashes you to your target and then damages enemies on impact. If you are already in melee range, you can cancel this skill right away and still deal damage. If above 5 <Effect name="Blight"/>, this attack will consume 5 stacks and deal extra damage.
- <Skill name="Voracious Arc"/> leaps you into the targeted area while evading, deals damage and <Control name="Daze"/> the enemy. If above 10 <Effect name="Blight"/>, this attack will consume 10 stacks and deal extra damage.
- <Skill name="Vital Draw"/> is the only Shroud skill you will not actively use in your rotation. However, it is a strong CC skill that will deal 300 break bar damage to enemies around you.

</Card>

</GridItem>

<GridItem sm="6">

<Card title="Elixirs">

- As a <Specialization name="Harbinger"/> you gain access to Elixirs as utility skills.
- Using an Elixir grants you Boons (that are shared with your allies when running <Trait name="Twisted Medicine"/>). Then the elixir will be thrown at your target location inflicting Conditions on your enemy.
- If you are in the splash area of the Elixir, you gain <Effect name="Blight"/>.
- If you are above the Blight threshold (5 for heal/utility, 10 for the elite), you will lose this amount of <Effect name="Blight"/> to enhance the damage of the Elixir.
- Using Elixirs will help us upkeep
- The most commonly used Elixirs are <Skill name="Elixir of Promise"/>, <Skill name="Elixir of Risk"/> and <Skill name="Elixir of Anguish"/> with <Skill name="Elixir of Promise"/> being the most interesting one for damage due to its <Condition name="Poisoned"/> application and the other 2 giving very useful boons.
- <Skill name="Elixir of Bliss"/> can help cleansing conditions while <Skill name="Elixir of Ignorance"/> acts as a stun-break. However keep in mind that delaying your Elixirs also means delaying your <Effect name="Blight"/> application.

</Card>

<Card title="Important Traits">

- <Trait name="Plague Sending"/> will transfer up to 2 conditions from you after entering <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/>. Always use <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> right before entering your Shroud to transfer the conditions for extra damage.
- <Trait name="Twisted Medicine"/> (<Boon name="Quickness"/> variant) shares the boons from Elixirs with the group helping to upkeep many different boons. It also converts 13% of your <Attribute name="Vitality"/> into <Attribute name="Concentration"/> which, in fractals, allows us to run without any additional <Attribute name="Concentration"/> gear for the <Boon name="Quickness"/> variant.
- <Trait name="Deathly Haste"/> (<Boon name="Quickness"/> variant) pulses <Boon name="Quickness"/> around you while in Shroud. Together with the Elixirs, this is your main way of keeping up this boon for your group.
- <Trait name="Dark Gunslinger"/> (DPS variant) reduces the cooldown of Pistol skills. It also converts 13% of your <Attribute name="Vitality"/> into <Attribute name="Expertise"/> which allows us to run with <Item name="Nightmare" type="Rune"/> and almost cap both <Condition name="Bleeding"/> and <Condition name="Torment"/> duration.
- <Trait name="Doom approaches"/> (DPS variant) pulses <Condition name="Torment"/> around you while in Shroud.

<Card title="General Information">

- Enter <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/> approx. every 20 seconds.
- You gain Life Force when units around you die or from some skills, namely <Skill name="Weeping Shots"/>, <Skill name="Vile Blast"/> and <Skill name="Devouring Darkness"/> as well as entering <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Deathly Swarm"/> and <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/> (triggering <Trait name="Plague Sending"/>) to transfer Conditions you get from <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> and <Skill name="Plaguelands"/> to the boss.
- Use all 3 Elixirs off-cooldown to keep up Blight. They have the same cooldown. Use <Skill name="Elixir of Promise"/> last to ensure you are using it above the Blight threshold doubling the duration of the <Condition name="Poisoned"/> it applies.
- Try to stay on Pistol as much as possible. Ideally, you will never use a single auto-attack on Scepter. It is just for using <Skill name="Devouring Darkness"/> and <Skill name="Grasping Dead"/> before and after every other <Skill name="Harbinger Shroud"/>.

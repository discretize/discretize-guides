The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="warrior"/> is the strongest build for <Specialization name="warrior"/> in fractals, provided at least one of the following is true:

1) Your group will be able to break all necessary defiance bars near instantly without core Warrior’s fast recharging Skull Crack, or Rampage. 
2) Your group will be able to maintain 25 <Boon name="Might"/> without <Trait name="Phalanx Strength"/>.

Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs in <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> and having excellent single defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has relatively high burst and excellent sustained damage.

Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>. As a <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="warrior"/>, your focus is to maintain your unique party buffs and instantly contribute to breaking defiance bars, all the while making DPS players sweat nervously when they glance at their DPS meter.

<Card title="Situational">
If the group finds itself lacking <Boon name="Might"/>, you can replace <Skill name="Signet of Might"/> with <Skill name="For Great Justice!"/>, or if only a little CC is required, replace <Skill name="Headbutt"/> with <Skill name="Battle Standard"/>.

If the group finds itself lacking CC, you can replace <Skill name="Signet of Might"/> with <Skill name="Wild Blow"/>. If CC is still short, it may be worthwhile swapping to <Specialization text="Banner Warrior" name="warrior"/>. Slow defiance bars leading to longer phases and potential might issues should be avoided if you can do anything about it.

For bosses with longer phases such as Ensolyss or Arkk, consider replacing <Trait name="Savage Instinct"/> with <Trait name="Smash Brawler"/> to improve berserk uptime.

For boss fights such as the Brazen Gladiator in the Chaos Fractal, with no initial defiance bar or phases, consider swapping <Trait name="Peak Performance"/> for <Trait name="Brave Stride"/>, <Trait name="Savage Instinct"/> for <Trait name="Smash Brawler"/>, and <Skill name="Mending"/> for <Skill name="Blood Reckoning"/>, as the benefit of peak performance is reduced.

<Card title="Skill usage">
Pre-fight:
* Use both charges of <Skill name="For Great Justice!"/>.
* If a fire field isn’t present, equip an offhand torch and use <Skill name="Flames of War"/>.
* If you haven’t needed to precast your banners at the boss, use them to blast the fire field for 6 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> per banner.
* If you have precast your banners, use <Skill name="Call to Arms"/> on offhand warhorn twice using the _Mistlock Singularity_.
* Cast <Skill name="Mending"/> immediately before the boss becomes vulnerable.
* If there is a defiance bar present immediately at the start of the fight, start on your Mace/Mace set - otherwise swap to it when necessary.
* With <Item name="Paralyzation" type="Sigil"/> you can deal 820 defiance bar damage with
    * <Skill name="Tremor"/>, you can precast it and cancel the aftercast animation
    * <Skill name="Pommel Bash"/>
    * <Skill name="Headbutt"/>
    * 
DPS:
* Camp Axe/Axe if no CC is required.
* It is key that you are in <Skill name="Berserk"/> mode for as many burn phases as possible for maximum DPS. Pay attention to your groups phase times and your <Skill name="Berserk"/> extensions. It is better for <Skill name="Berserk"/> to drop when the boss isn’t stunned if that means it will be back up right before another burst window.
</Card>

<Card title="Damage modifiers">
* Entering <Skill name="Berserk"/> grants 3 stacks of <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/>, while <Skill name="Decapitate"/> only grants 1. You will find <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/> starting to run low when out of <Skill name="Berserk"/>, try to make sure you are in <Skill name="Berserk"/> for burn phases while also not delaying <Skill name="Berserk"/> where possible.
* Casting <Skill name="Mending"/> for <Trait name="Peak Performance"/> is only a DPS gain if you can’t be hitting something else, use it right before the start of DPS phases but only use it during if you need the heal.
* With 100% critical chance, <Trait name="Axe mastery"/>, and <Skill name="Berserk"/>, it will take 3 hits to charge <Skill name="Decapitate"/>. Combine <Skill name="Cyclone Axe"/> / <Skill name="Double Chop"/> with <Skill name="Throw Axe"/> or a single auto-attack. Only use <Skill name="Throw Axe"/> outside <Skill name="Berserk"/> to prevent its ammo count fully recharging.
* Interrupting your auto-attack chain to use <Skill name="Decapitate"/> or enter <Skill name="Berserk"/> is a DPS increase
Keep in mind that <Skill name="Crushing Blow"/> inflicts 15x  <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> if your party is running low, and can often be used with no DPS loss if you are on your mace set waiting to CC.

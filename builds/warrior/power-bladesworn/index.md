The <Specialization text="Power Bladesworn" name="Bladesworn"/> is a strong build for <Specialization name="Warrior"/> in fractals. It has more initial burst than <Specialization text="Power Berserker" name="Berserker"/> thanks to <Skill name="Dragon Trigger" />, but loses sustained damage in favor of short damage spikes. Along with this <Specialization text="Power Bladesworn" name="Bladesworn"/> provides a lot of boon support to a party, sharing <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Quickness"/> from traits along with optional utility skills like <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/> which can carry a party with low boon uptime by providing 12 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> (becomes 20 stacks, taking into account <Boon name="Might"/> from traits) and a high <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime.

The <Specialization text="Power Bladesworn" name="Bladesworn"/> is one of the harder builds to play in fractals dues to its quick rotation, relying on maintaining damage modifiers and your highest damaging skill locking you in place, requiring good positioning during fights. Furthermore, the build benefits from damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

On fights that you don't benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>, you can adjust your gear to use <Item id="24618"/> and more Berserkers stats for a damage increase.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage" />
<Warning>

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

- Casting <Skill name="Mending"/> for <Trait name="Peak Performance"/> is only a DPS gain if you can’t be hitting something else, use it right before the start of DPS phases but only use it during if you need the heal.
- <Skill name="Triggerguard"/> and <Skill name="Flicker Step"/> in <Skill name="Dragon Trigger"/> are used in the rotation, but should be saved to use to deal with mechanics if needed.

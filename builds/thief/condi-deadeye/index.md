<Message>
This build is [META](/guides/meta-explained) in Sunqua Peak. In terms of DPS, this build is unlikely to fall behind any other specialization, whether they be running a power or condi build, as it has very high sustained DPS on single targets. It is however not recommanded to play **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** on encounters where power builds would perform better: a condi build will always have a tendancy to interfere with a power composition, as it is not meant to have a higher upfront or burst damage. It is worth mentioning that _Venom Skills_ are very strong, and precasting them on the _Mistlock Singularity_ will allow for a very high burst, quite uncommon for condi builds but very valuable.

The **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** is quite a selfish build, that will not provide your party with any form of support. Instead, the value of this build comes almost entirely from the pure damage that it will bring, which is inflated by the **<Specialization text="Condi Soulbeast" name="Soulbeast"/>**'s <Skill id="40498"/>, on top of Venom Skills which can be precasted on the _Mistlock Singularity_, and casted again as soon as your allies have consummed them by attacking the target. Consequently, the **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** is able to apply a tremendous amount of <Condition name="Poisoned"/> and <Condition name="Bleeding"/> instances, as well as an unneglectable amount of <Condition name="Torment"/>. As such, it is necessary to be running with a <Item id="44944"/> as it will become very valuable in bursting phases. Lastly, <Skill id="13132"/> can bring up to 750 Defiance Bar damage, if used at the proper moment, meaning if all instances of this ability are consummed when the boss is vulnerable to this type of damage (up to ten stacks, two per player).

This build possesses a decent amount of self-sustain, due to <Trait id="2111"/>, but it suffers greatly from a <Boon name="Quickness"/> deficit. However, it doesn't suffer too much from a lack of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> due to the nature of _Initiative_.

Overall, this build is an excellent pick if taken as an alt class: it is meant for players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward rotations. Played correctly, it is excellent in PuGs on single-target bosses such as the ones from Challenge Mode Fractals, most notably Sorrowful Spellcaster (Light and Dark Ai) and Ensolyss, or any boss with little to no phases. We do not recommand running this build in 99CM, as positioning is most important there, and jumping <Skill name="shadowstrike"/> becomes terrible due to Cosmic Energy (low gravity). Details for this build can be found at the bottom of the page.

- Note that there are two slightly different variants of this build: one is meant for bosses with very short phases such as Ensolyss or Light Ai; the other one is meant for longer fights, where you will need to sustain damage for a longer period of time. This will also depend on your group. It will always be better to use the first variant with people you do not know well, or in situations where your party doesn't bring enough damage.
- <Item name="afflicted"/> is a viable, more accessible alternative.
- If healing isn't an issue, this is the perfect build to use <Item name="writofmasterfulmalice"/> over <Item name="tuningicicle"/> ! <Skill name="signetofmalice"/> is also the strongest healing ability you can bring to maintain your health over 90%, if you feel you don't need <Skill name="hideinshadows"/>.

### High-Burst Variant

This variant is meant for short-duration fights or bosses with short phases; without any Cantrip slotted, take <Trait name="maliciousintent"/> over <Trait name="oneinthechamber"/>. Take <Skill id="13026"/> over <Skill name="devourervenom"/> on Ensolyss, or <Skill name="mercy"/> with <Trait name="oneinthechamber"/> if group DPS is not high enough not to run out of _Initiative_.

<Divider text="Details"/>

Watching videos of players performing the rotation for this build, one might think that it is easy to play; after all, the **<Specialization text="Thief" name="Thief"/>** tends to have spammy rotations, for the same reason mentionned before. The _Initiative_ system allows for multiple, redundant casts of the same ability, during the entire duration of the fight. It is easy to see that one ability will always perform better than other ones, based on the ratio of damage dealt over _Initiative_ points spent. Here are a the main reasons as to why this rotation isn't actually as easy as it looks.

- The **<Specialization text="Condi Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** has three primary damaging abilities: <Skill id="50466"/>, <Skill id="59526"/>, and <Skill id="13010"/>. Due to the nature of <Skill id="13010"/> (which has to be casted to enable <Skill id="59526"/>), this rotation becomes very tricky, as it forces your character to Shadowstep Backwards: this is because the intention behind designing the Pistol/Dagger setup was probably to make a kiting kit, and it was never really meant to be a Best in Slot DPS kit. One way to bypass this is to **jump** during, or immediately after casting <Skill id="13010"/>. Not only is it an inconvenience for the rotation, but it also lowers your DPS slighty, as there will be a small, but significant delay where you will still be up in the air, unable to make your next move. It is necessary to jump <Skill id="13010"/> sometimes, such as when Dark Ai pulses AoEs in a set ring pattern, so as not to lose too much health, and fall into Downstate far away from your friends.
- The rotation requires a good sense of timing, as do pretty much all **<Specialization text="Deadeye" name="Deadeye"/>** builds, to maximize your DPS: timing some abilities incorrectly, such as <Skill id="41372"/> (which will consume your Malice in exchange for some _Initiative_ points), can have dramatic consequences for the rest of the fight: you might end up being completely unable to use any ability whatsoever, because you have run out of _Initiative_ points to spend. Not being able to use abilities keeps your Malice bar too low, and this chain reaction can leave you powerless to do anything, until you can use <Skill name="mercy"/> or <Skill name="deadeyesmark"/> again.
- Missing an ability like <Skill name="shadowstrike"/> or hitting nothing but thin air with <Skill name="repeater"/>, both of which might happen from being out of range, will unecessarily use up some of your _Initiative_, and might delay your <Trait id="2111"/> which could cause some issues for the rest of the fight, like not filling up your _Initiative_ bar at the proper moment.
- It is important to learn the rotation by heart, if you do not fully understand the _Malice_ mechanic. abilities such as <Skill id="50466"/> are only enabled when you are under the effect of <Effect name="Stealth"/>; notably, the latter has additional effects when Malice is consumed, so it is important _not_ to use <Skill name="mercy"/> before, or while casting it. Specifically, <Skill name="mercy"/> should always be used upon completing the <Skill id="50466"/>, so as not to interfere with <Effect name="stealth"/>-application skills like the random F2 Stolen skills (<Skill name="stealtime"/>, ...), <Skill name="hideinshadows"/> or <Skill name="shadowmeld"/>.
- Stolen abilities (<Skill name="stealhealth"/>, <Skill name="stealstrength"/>...) should _not_ be used if you have less than four _Malice_ points, as four of them ought to be consumed to provide you with <Effect name="Stealth"/>, enabling <Skill id="50466"/>.
- Lastly, it should be understood that <Trait id="2136"/> is a crucial trait for longer fights, as the use of a cantrip like <Skill name="shadowmeld"/> or <Skill name="Mercy"/> will allow you to use a second Stolen ability, on top of the one that the <Skill name="deadeyesmark"/> gives you every twenty seconds or so.

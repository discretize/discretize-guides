<Warning>
<Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> is an incredibly strong build to play in T4 fractals and is a great build to swap to if you play <BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/> in CMs. In T4s recognising when to swap between <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> and <Specialization name="Specter" text="Condi Specter"/> will be a massive gain to your team and well worth the extra effort, making thief a very rewarding class to play!
</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> has great sustained DPS, great burst on stacked trash mobs, good single target burst, brings excellent crowd control and offers <Effect name="Stealth"/>, which paired with top tier mobility thanks to <Skill id= 	"13014"/>, <Skill id="13025"/>, <Skill id="13002"/> and <Skill id="13064"/> can enable fast skips in T4s. <Specialization name="Daredevil"/> has a very simplistic rotation, which makes it fairly easy to play, but due to initiative and energy management, <Specialization name="Daredevil"/> becomes quite hard to master.

In fractals <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> does have some drawbacks:

1. While being a very strong build on a lot of T4s, <Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> struggles to keep up with other power builds on CMs, but a lot of value comes from the utility, CC and skips it can provide.
2. Because of <Trait id="2047"/>, you may be pushing your teammates on fractals with <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/> instability into deadly zones.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

Relics:

- <Item id="100916"> is a good default option and the best option for phases longer than 20s/split phases without adds.
- <Item id= "100916"> is a great alternative for short phases and fights without split phases with adds. If you wanna pre-cast your elite skill before a fight, make sure to swap out the relic first, use the elite skill and then swap it back in.
Alternative weapons:

- Staff with <Item id="36053" disableText/> / <Item id="24615" disableText/> and slaying sigils
- A Shortbow to stack <Boon name="Might"/>, <Effect name="Stealth"/> and to use for skips and mobility
- A Sword/Pistol set to use for skips and opening CC

With <Skill name="Signet of Agility"/>, you will be critcapped even without the flank bonus from <Trait id="1268"/> when fighting non-defiant foes.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>

### Notes

Staff 5 <Skill id="30597"/> is worth using if you can hit 4 or more mobs at once. Especially since staff autoattacks and <Skill id="29911"/> can only hit 3 targets. So on big groups of trash mobs you should just spam <Skill id="30597"/> and then finish them with <Skill id="13085"/>.

Another amazing shortbow skill is <Skill id="13041"/> (Shortbow 2). It is a blast finisher with a low initiative cost. Use it to blast <Boon name="Might"/> and <Effect name="Stealth"/> with fire and smoke fields respectively.

Keep in mind you can precast skills like <Skill id="13037"/>, <Skill id="13082"/> or <Skill id="13132"/> and take the mistlock singularity to refresh their coolddown. For example: Precast <Skill id="13082"/>, take mistlock, cast <Skill id="13132"/>, and swap to <Skill id="13082"/> again.

Although <Specialization name="Daredevil"/> doesn't have access to <Effect name="Superspeed"/>, you can use a template with <Item id="85244"/> or <Item id="49940"/> to execute even more skips for your party in T4s.

### Rotation

## Precast:

Blast might with <Skill id="13041"/>. Cast <Skill id="13037"/>, <Skill id="13055"/>, <Skill id="13096"/> and <Skill id="13082"/>, take mistlock and swap to normal skills. Dodge 2 times, use <Skill id="13027"/> and dodge last time, right before fight starts.

10. <Skill id="29911"/> 2x (Staff 2)

**Loop while waiting for <Skill id="13046"/> to be off cooldown:**

2. Dodge
3. <Skill id="29911"/> (Staff 2) (Do it **2x** if you get max Initiative while you are waiting for <Skill id="13046"/>)

You can also activate <Skill id="13046"/> to burst for the last few attacks of a fight.
